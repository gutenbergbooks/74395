<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>There has been much discussion about the time at which
Belgian history should be said to begin. Belgium, as an
entirely autonomous, independent kingdom, has existed
only since 1830. But the Belgium of 1830 was, in a certain
way, a creation of European diplomacy and the result
of centuries of struggle for personal and political freedom.
Belgium, as a country, and the Belgians, as a people,
existed long before. Since the time of Caesar (57 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>),
history tells us of the Belgians, “the bravest of all the
people of Gaul,” and, although the Germanic invasions of
the fourth and fifth centuries have added a new ethnical
element to the old Belgian stock, it is from the time of the
Roman conqueror that the history of the Belgian people
really begins. As for Belgium as a united political body,
one must go back to the fifteenth century, when the dukes
of Burgundy succeeded in unifying all the Belgian duchies
and counties under one dynasty. Before that time, Belgium
had practically consisted of two very distinct parts,
Lotharingia in the east, Flanders in the west, separated
by the river Scheldt. Lotharingia was, politically speaking,
a part of the mediaeval German empire; Flanders was
in subjugation to the kingdom of France. Each succeeded—Lotharingia
first, then Flanders—in evading the political
domination of Germany and France, respectively, and
drew closer and closer together during the last centuries
of the Middle Ages. That work of union was achieved
by the Burgundian dukes, who inherited from the local<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
Lotharingian and Flemish dynasties, in the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>But in the Middle Ages not only did the increasing tendency
of union between Lotharingia and Flanders exist,
but there was also a strong factor of national union, the
common civilization, the common culture, of Lotharingia
and Flanders. The inhabitants of the different duchies
and counties were united by the same religion, the same
artistic and economic aims, the same political institutions,
although there were, of course, some local differences of
minor importance. Since early in the Middle Ages the
Belgian people had possessed a distinctive though mutually
common civilization, and the local differences which
existed and which were more or less well defined at the
outset disappeared gradually as the different parts of the
country drew closer together politically.</p>

<p>The history of Belgium and the Belgian people does not
begin to date merely from 1830, not even from the fifteenth
century. It dates in fact from the time when, during the
fifth century, Gallo-Romans and Germanic invaders intermingled
and laid the basis of that ethnical and linguistic
duality that has been for many centuries the characteristic
of the Belgian populace and has impressed its mark on
the whole course of Belgian history.</p>

<p>The real unity of the history of Belgium in ante-modern
times has been brought into notice by one of
Belgium’s leading historians, Henri Pirenne, professor in
the University of Ghent, in his admirable work, <i>Histoire
de Belgique</i>. Before the publication of this work, few
scholars understood how to treat the history of Belgium
during the Middle Ages. Having in mind only the political
aspect of that history, they were lost in the particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
history of the various duchies and counties; they saw
scarcely any link between the facts of these different historical
sections, and they forgot entirely to take account
of the unifying factor—the common culture and civilization.</p>

<p>Since historians have had their attention called to that
unifying factor, the history of Belgium has been looked
upon in a different manner. It is in the light of that
method that I shall try to explain the course of the historical
development of the country.</p>

<p>The national culture of Belgium is a synthesis, if I may
so call it, where one finds the genius of two races—the
Romance and the Germanic—mingled, yet modified by
the imprint of the distinctively Belgian. It is in that very
receptivity—the fact that it has absorbed and unified the
best elements of Latin and Teutonic civilization—that the
originality of the Belgian national culture resides.</p>

<p>These distinctive marks of national culture, denoting
the unity of a people, and serving, both in the Middle Ages
and today, to distinguish the Belgian nation from the
other nations of Europe, may be described as a common
desire for independence and freedom, a jealous regard for
those popular rights which serve as a guaranty of the continuance
of independence and freedom, and a deeply
religious spirit. In the course of their history the Belgians
have always cast off the yoke of those princes who, like
Philip II, Joseph II, and William I of Holland, attacked
their liberties and privileges, or who, like Joseph II and
William I of Holland, tried to impose their own religious
beliefs on them.</p>

<p>Those characteristics of the Belgian nation, as well as
its common civilization, were born during the Middle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
Ages. For that reason I shall deal in a special manner
with the different aspects of religious, artistic, literary, and
economic life during that period. After the treatment of
the political unity of the Belgian provinces achieved in the
fifteenth century, more attention will be given to the
political aspect of events, without, however, entirely
neglecting the different forms of popular life and social
activity.</p>

<p>The history of Belgium may be divided into the following
periods: (1) the formative period, including the time
of the Roman occupation, the invasion of the Franks, and
the reign of Charles the Great and his immediate heirs
(57 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> to 843 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>); (2) the period of feudalism; (3) the
rise of the communes (eleventh to fourteenth century);
(4) the political centralization of the dukes of Burgundy
(fifteenth century); (5) the Spanish rule (sixteenth to
seventeenth century); (6) the Austrian rule (eighteenth
century); (7) the French régime (1792-1815); (8) the
Dutch rule and the revolution of 1830; (9) the period
of national independence.</p>

<p>During all these periods of history the names “Belgium”
and “Belgians” have not been uniformly those by
which the country and its people have been designated.
The name “Belgae,” of Celtic origin, was given in Caesar’s
time to the confederation of Celtic tribes which occupied
the territory of Belgium, when for the first time the Roman
legions came in contact with them. The name Belgium,
“Belgica,” disappeared with the Roman occupation and
does not reappear until the sixteenth century. During
the sixteenth century, and especially at the beginning of
the seventeenth, the name “Belgium” is to be found in
books, but seems not to have been used as a common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
designation. As a distinctive name for a race or people,
the term “Belges” became generally used at the end of
the eighteenth century, its adjectival form being then
“belgique” (<i>les provinces belgiques</i>, “the Belgian provinces”).
Between the end of the Roman occupation and
the end of the eighteenth century the Belgians were successively
known as “Franks,” “Lotharingi,” and “Flemings.”
Since the thirteenth century, the country itself
has been called “Netherlands” (<i>partes advallenses</i>), when
the name Lotharingia disappeared as a political term.
The term “Burgundian provinces” was sometimes used in
the fifteenth century, while the name “Flanders,” “Fiandra,”
“Flandes,” was mainly applied during the Spanish
rule. During the Austrian rule the name “Austrian
Netherlands” was the prevailing designation.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The term
“Netherlands” was applied, not only to the actual territory
of Belgium, but to the countries which today
correspond to the territories included in the kingdoms of
Belgium and Holland. From the time of the Roman occupation
until 1588 Belgium and Holland have, indeed, a
somewhat common history. Since 1588, when the provinces
of the north separated from the south as the United
Provinces of the Netherlands, Belgium and Holland have
existed as separate states, and have no longer a common
history.</p>

<p>We shall not attempt to deal here with the history of
the northern provinces from the early Middle Ages down
to 1588, for that is the task of the historian of Holland,
and although, politically speaking, the provinces of Belgium
and Holland both shared the same vicissitudes
until 1588, yet, as has been pointed out by Professor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>Colenbrander,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> from the point of view of artistic, literary,
and economic life the national culture of the two was
quite distinct.</p>

<p>On the other hand, included in this history is that of
the principality of Liège. Liège was never a part of the
Netherlands; until 1795 it was an ecclesiastical state with
a separate entity, ruled by bishops, princes of the Holy
Roman Empire. But Liège had a civilization, and especially
institutions, common to those of the other Belgian
provinces, and, geographically and historically speaking,
it was really a part of Belgium.</p>

<p>Having thus indicated what is to be dealt with in this
<i>Short History of Belgium</i>, it remains only to mention the
bibliographical list appended at the close of the work,
which includes the most important books on general
Belgian history. A reference to these will facilitate a
deeper study of the subject and will enable the student
to enter more in detail into the history of the country.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The editors have urged me to add in this edition a final
chapter on the history of Belgium during the Great War.
These events, of course, do not yet belong to history, but
it seems possible to give at least a brief sketch of what
happened in Belgium during the invasion and the German
occupation. The knowledge which we have acquired in
the year that has elapsed since the armistice has enabled
us to establish the facts.</p>

<p class="center">THE PERIOD OF FORMATION</p>

<p>When, in 57 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the Roman Republic, then in control
of most of the Mediterranean countries, the south of Gaul
included, determined to conquer also the rest of that
country, Belgium was occupied by a people of Celtic origin,
called the Belgians, “Belgae.” They were a part of
the larger group of the Gauls who possessed the country
between the Pyrennees, the Alps, the Rhine, and the sea.
The Belgians occupied, not only the actual territory of
Belgium, but also a part of Northern France and of Rhenish
Prussia. They formed a confederation of several
tribes, among which the Nervians, dwelling in the provinces
of Hainaut, Brabant, and Flanders, were the most
important.</p>

<p>The Roman general, Julius Caesar, intrusted with the
task of subduing the north of Gaul, attacked the Belgians
in 57 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The Roman army would have been routed by
the Nervians in the first attack but for Caesar, who himself
led the troops and saved the day. Notwithstanding
a fierce guerrilla warfare that lasted four years, all the
Belgian tribes were successively subdued and some of
them exterminated. Their heroic resistance made Caesar
say of them: “Among all the Gauls, the bravest are the
Belgians.”</p>

<p>Once subdued, Belgium accepted the Roman rule and
remained loyal to the Empire. Civilization was rapidly
introduced; great military roads were constructed through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
the Belgian forests and marshes, connecting the different
towns, and along their course villages were built and
farms developed. Tongres and Tournai became entirely
Romanized cities, where splendid monuments were built;
remains of these are still to be found today. Farms
were laid out and country houses were erected according
to Roman pattern, with such changes as were imposed by
the rigors of the northern climate. The Belgians adopted
Roman manners and customs and the Latin language:
they became Gallo-Romans, and even the national gods
were renamed with Roman names.</p>

<p>If Belgium shared the splendor and the civilization of
the Roman Empire, it shared also the disastrous days of
its decline. There came a time when the Empire, once
so strong, but now growing weaker and weaker, was quite
unable to resist the hordes of barbarians, which, coming
from the dark forests of Germany, threatened the rich
provinces of Gaul, and Italy itself, with invasion. From
the third century on, Franks and Alamans devastated Gaul
and left the wealthy territories covered with ruins. The
emperors did not succeed in expelling the Franks from the
country: those tribes of Teutonic race were allowed to
remain in the northern parts of Belgium, Flanders and
Campine,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and became soldiers of the Empire. They
early became dissatisfied with the territory allotted to
them and resumed their march southward, conquering the
whole of Belgium. The year 406 witnessed a terrible
catastrophe. The Teutons, driven out of their country
by the invasion of the Huns, burst like a hurricane upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>the unfortunate provinces of Belgium, burned and devastated
everything on their march, destroyed Tongres and
Tournai, and finally, swarming over the Alps and the
Pyrennees, invaded both Italy and Spain. After their
passage, Belgium was left undefended by the Roman
legions, recalled to defend Italy itself, and the Franks of
Flanders and Campine occupied the abandoned territory
without difficulty.</p>

<p>The conquest by the Franks is an important event in
Belgian history. Indeed, it is from the fifth century that
the bilingualism and the ethnographical dualism of Belgium
may be said to date. The Franks, composed of
two tribes, the Salians and the Ripuarians, advanced
from the north and the east into Belgium and occupied
the country in such a way that the actual provinces of
Flanders, Antwerp, Limburg, the larger part of Brabant,
and Liège fell into their power. Farther south they did
not enter Belgium: their march was stopped by a dense
and extended forest which, in Southwestern and Central
Belgium, constituted the continuation of the forests of the
Ardennes. The forest in question was called Sylva Carbonaria,
“Coal Wood,” and covered the largest part of the
actual province of Hainaut, the seat of the modern Belgian
coal industry. Behind the curtain of that forest the oldest
inhabitants of the country, the Gallo-Romans, remained
free from oppression by the invaders and retained
their Latin culture and civilization. So Belgium was
separated by the Sylva Carbonaria into two quite distinct
parts: the northern part, occupied by the Franks, with
their Teutonic culture and civilization; the southern part,
occupied by the Gallo-Romans. A line was thus drawn
dividing the Belgian people, and an ethnical and linguistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
duality, destined to remain for centuries one of the main
characteristics of the country, was established. Indeed,
the Walloons<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of today are the descendants of the old
Gallo-Romans from behind the limits of the Sylva
Carbonaria, and the Flemings of Northern Belgium are
the descendants of the Franks. This line drawn in the
fifth century has undergone little change in the course
of ages and, although the famous coal wood disappeared
many centuries ago, the separation between Walloons and
Flemings has remained more or less apparent down to the
present. In this case the Sylva Carbonaria played a
part like that of the Alps in the case of the Romanches
and the Italians of the Tessino, and that of the hills
of Wales and Cornwall in the case of the Britons of
England.</p>

<p>The first king of the Franks known in history is Clodion,
who conquered the countries of Tournai and Cambrai and
established the seat of his realm in Tournai. It is in this
town that his grave was discovered in 1653; the King was
found buried, according to the customs of his people, together
with his arms and royal ornaments; he was identified
by the presence of a ring on which his likeness and his
name were engraved.</p>

<p>It was from Tournai that the famous descendant of
Clodion, King Clodovech, started his campaign of further
conquest that gave him possession of Northern France
and, after the war against the Burgundians and the West-goths
(506), the control of nearly the whole of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>country. From this time on, the Frankish kings established
their capital at Paris. Belgium is no longer associated
with the recollection of their glorious deeds.</p>

<p>Clodion and his successors, so far as we know by the
general history of Europe, belonged to the so-called
dynasty of the Merovingians. The kings of that dynasty,
in the course of the seventh century, were weaklings,
actually dominated by their powerful ministers, the
mayors of the palace. One of these, Peppin, in 751,
succeeded in becoming himself a king and was the
founder of a new royal dynasty, the Carolingians.</p>

<p>The new dynasty was, geographically speaking, essentially
a Belgian dynasty, for it had many possessions in
Eastern Belgium and all its members had occupied influential
offices at the court of the Austrasian kings, who,
in the sixth and seventh centuries, ruled over that part
of the country.</p>

<p>The most famous of the Carolingians is Charles the
Great, who re-established the old Roman Empire (800)
and who, by successful campaigns, succeeded in extending
his domination over the territory lying between the river
Elbe, the Bohemian mountains, and the Raab on the
east, the sea on the west, the North Sea, and the
Garigliano River in Italy and the Ebro River in Spain on
the south.</p>

<p>The favorite residence of the great Emperor was at Aix,
and this contributed largely to the development of Belgian
trade and industry at the beginning of the ninth century.
Politically abandoned by the Frankish kings when they
moved to Paris, Belgium again became important in the
time of Charles the Great as the most favorably located
portion of the Frankish Empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span></p>

<p>Belgium is, indeed, for trade purposes, the natural
meeting-ground of the West-European nations. Lying
between England, France, Germany, and Holland, it has
good water communications with each. Though not
quite so near the English coast as a corner of France is, it
has the great advantage of exactly fronting the mouth of
the Thames. With France it is connected by the upper
courses of the Lys, the Scheldt, the Sambre, and the
Meuse, the last named being navigable by deep-draught
vessels far into Lorraine. With Germany its connection
is less direct, the outlet of the Rhine running of course
through Holland.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>These geographical conditions played a large part in
the development of Belgian trade in the time of Charles
the Great. The presence of the imperial palace at Aix
attracted a great deal of traffic: from every part of the
empire merchants, soldiers, priests, in short all classes of
people, came through Belgium in order to reach the residence
of the Emperor, and their presence resulted in
unparalleled prosperity in that part of the Carolingian
empire. Charles the Great was not only a great soldier
and legislator, but also a man who knew the importance
of the Christian religion in cultural matters. During his
reign the development of religious life in the different parts
of the empire grew rapidly.</p>

<p>Something ought to be said concerning the introduction
of the Christian religion into Belgium. The preaching
of the gospel in Belgium goes back as far as the Roman
occupation of the time of the Empire, but the religious
organization of the church in the country dates from
the middle of the fourth century. At that time we find
in the city of Tongres the oldest historically known
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>bishop of Belgium, St. Servatius. The historical origin of
the bishoprics of Arras, Tournai, Boulogne, Cambrai—all
of them at that time in Belgian territory—remains a
matter of conjecture. The baptism of King Clodovech in
496 made the development of the Christian religion easier,
although the conversion of the King to the Catholic faith
did not at all mean the conversion of the whole people.
Large parts of Belgium, especially the eastern part,
remained heathen until the eighth century, and the introduction
of the Christian religion in these sections of the
country is mainly the work of missionaries. These
missionaries worked on their own initiative, without any
such prearranged plan as, for instance, existed for the
introduction of Catholicism into England. It was mainly
by Irish and Anglo-Saxon missionaries that the gospel
was made known, and the most famous of those heralds
of the Catholic religion was the Anglo-Saxon missionary
Willibrord. The work of the missionaries was completed
by the bishops, who visited large portions of their very
extensive dioceses. Bishops Eligius, Amandus, Lambert,
and Hubert are closely connected with the religious
history of Belgium in the seventh and eighth centuries.
The boundaries of the dioceses corresponded exactly with
the limits of the old administrative circles of the Roman
Empire, the provinces. In the eighth century, Belgium
was divided into the dioceses of Noyon-Tournai,
Térouanne (later Saint-Omer), Arras, Cambrai, Liège, and
Utrecht. The dioceses of Utrecht and Liège were subject
to the metropolitan church of Cologne, the others to the
metropolitan church of Rheims.</p>

<p>These dioceses had been established without taking into
account the racial differences existing between the inhabitants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
of the ecclesiastical territory. Including in the same
diocese Gallo-Romans and Franks, the church, unconsciously
of course, prepared the inhabitants of Belgium
for the task of being intermediaries between the Latin
and the Teutonic civilization. The seats of the bishoprics
being mostly located in the Romance section of the
country, the inhabitants of the Teutonic section were
obliged to meet the Walloons: they had the same religious
center. As a result of this action of the church, the
national or racial differences were diminished and the
linguistic frontier no more operated as a barrier in any
real sense between the people it separated.</p>

<p>If the conversion to the Catholic faith was mainly the
task of the missionaries, the introduction of civilization
was mainly the task of the monasteries. Here the Benedictine
monks played a very large part, both as civilizers
and as colonizers. Their monasteries were, from the
sixth century on, centers of economic and intellectual life.
While some of their monks attacked the thick forests of
Southern and Central Belgium with axes, others engaged
in literary labors in the monasteries’ libraries, transcribing
the ancient Greek and Latin manuscripts, composing
hymns and Lives of Saints, and opening schools for the
education of the people. They planted in the very hearts
of the people the roots of that strong religious spirit, which
has steadily developed, and which has become one of the
characteristics of the national spirit of Belgium.</p>

<p>Each monastery became a kind of model farm, where
the population of the neighborhood could learn the best
agricultural methods. In the monastery, too, they could
find physicians who knew how to take care of the sick.
The monastery, being protected by the respect that was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
inspired by the saint to whom it was dedicated, was also
a place of safety in time of danger. Consequently,
dwellings became more and more numerous around the
monasteries, and villages developed under their influence
and protection.</p>

<p>It is not, then, surprising that in the course of time
tales and legends developed wherein the founders of those
monasteries became the heroes of poetical and sometimes
extraordinary adventures. In this manner did the people
of mediaeval times express their gratitude for all they
owed to those early pioneers of culture and civilization.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE PERIOD OF FEUDALISM</p>

<p>Charles the Great died in 814. His son, Emperor
Louis, was a weakling, and after his death the mighty
empire of Charles was destroyed by internal troubles and
civil war (840). Lotharius, the eldest son of Emperor
Louis, endeavored to seize the empire for himself. To prevent
this, both his brothers, Louis and Charles, leagued
themselves against him and defeated him in the terrible
battle of Fontanet, which has been characterized by contemporaries
as a “judgment of God.” The peace that was
later concluded between the three brothers led to the
famous Treaty of Verdun (843), an event of the utmost
importance in the history of Belgium.</p>

<p>The empire created by Charles the Great was divided
into three parts: the central part, including the largest
portion of Belgium, Holland, Italy, and the eastern part
of France, was allotted to Lotharius, together with the title
of Emperor; the western part of the empire, embracing
the largest part of France, and Flanders to the west of the
Scheldt, became the share of Charles; the eastern part,
which included nearly the whole of Germany and
certain parts of Austria-Hungary, was given to Louis.
The Treaty of Verdun practically cut the territory of Belgium
into two parts, separated by the Scheldt, and gave
each of them to a different ruler. These two sections of
Belgium remained separated during the Middle Ages,
and were not reunited until six centuries later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span></p>

<p>After the death of Emperor Lotharius (855) the northern
part of his central territory, located between the North
Sea and the Jura Mountains, was given to one of his sons,
Lotharius II. That section which included the entire
eastern part of Belgium to the Scheldt embraced peoples of
very different race and origin: Frisians, Franks, Alamans,
Walloons. As it was impossible to name the territory
after its inhabitants—they were of too many different
origins—it was named after its sovereign: <i>regnum Lotharii</i>,
“Lotharingia,” “the realm of Lotharius.”</p>

<p>In 870 the Treaty of Meerssen, whereby Charles, King
of France, and Louis, King of Germany, divided between
them the realm of Lotharius II, ended the existence of that
state. The second Treaty of Verdun in 879 finally settled
the status of Lotharingia: the boundary between France
and Germany was declared to be the river Scheldt, and the
whole of Lotharingia was incorporated in Germany. Of
course, all the parts of the former empire of Charles the
Great were once again united by the Emperor Charles the
Stout, but after all kinds of internal struggles, Lotharingia
was again—and this time for many centuries—annexed to
Germany in 925.</p>

<p>Belgium is thus divided into two tracts by the Scheldt:
the western part, Flanders, belonging to France and politically
influenced by that country; the eastern part,
Lotharingia, which was a dependency of Germany. As in
the establishment of the bishoprics, so here, no attention
was paid to the racial differences of the inhabitants.
Both Lotharingia and Flanders included peoples of
different origin: Flanders had inhabitants of Teutonic
origin in the north and inhabitants of Romance origin
in the south; Lotharingia included Flemings in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
east, the center, and the north, and Walloons in the
south.</p>

<p>Thus, at the beginning of the feudal system, there
existed no political and no linguistic unity in Belgium.
Moreover, although Flanders formed a politically united
body, Lotharingia was subdivided into several small principalities:
the duchy of Brabant, including the actual
provinces of Brabant and Antwerp, the county of Limburg,
the county of Namur, the duchy of Luxemburg, the
county of Hainaut, and two ecclesiastical principalities,
Cambrai and Liège.</p>

<p>The absence of political unity was a consequence of the
new political constitution of most of the countries of Western
Europe in the tenth century—of feudalism, so called.
In place of the former despotic and centralized power of the
King there was now to be found the locally asserted rule of
dukes, counts, viscounts, etc. These public officers who,
in the ninth century, were still subordinate agents of the
King, without any other power than that delegated to
them by their master, had succeeded, partly through the
weakness of the heirs of Charles the Great and partly on
account of the invasions of the Normans in the ninth
century and the incursion of the Hungarians in the tenth, in
grasping more firmly their delegated powers and in making
their military, political, and financial perquisites hereditary.
Thanks to the custom whereby the King granted them a
domain, called <i>beneficium</i>, as a reward for their services
or to insure their loyalty, they had succeeded in getting
a strong political foothold in their respective provinces,
and had continuously developed their possessions and their
influence. In the tenth century the dukes and counts,
formerly officers of the King, had won for themselves an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
independent and hereditary position. The kingdom was
now everywhere broken up into small principalities, practically
autonomous, where the King no longer exercised
his power and where the people were now dominated by
local dynasties. The new political organization, called
feudalism, existed, of course, in Belgium also, and
contributed in a large measure to the complete
absence of political and national unity throughout the
country.</p>

<p>Each county, each duchy, became a world apart, had
its own politics and made war on the neighboring principality,
or aided it in case of attack from others. So
Flanders enjoyed friendly relations with Cambrai and
Hainaut; Hainaut was on good terms with Namur and
Luxemburg. Sometimes they fought one another: Brabant
and Limburg were enemies for a long time. Later they
became united under the same princes. The same phenomenon
existed in the Northern Netherlands: Holland was
friendly toward Cleves, but fought against Gueldre on
account of Utrecht, against Flanders on account of
Zealand, against Utrecht on account of Friesland, etc.</p>

<p>For the most part, Flanders or the western part of
Belgium was a vassal of the French King; Lotharingia or
the eastern part of Belgium was a vassal of the German
Empire. The dependency of Lotharingia, however, was
less definite than was that of Flanders to France, for the
numerous principalities into which the former was broken
up introduced more autonomy for the local dynasties and
rendered intervention on the part of the Emperor more
difficult. Flanders, on the other hand, as a more homogeneous
territory, was more closely united with its feudal
lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span></p>

<p>The ultimate fate of Flanders and Lotharingia depended,
however, on the degree of independence that their
princes would be able to win. In accordance with the
general politics of all vassals, the counts of Flanders and
the dukes of Lotharingia dreamed of but one thing,
namely, of escape from the domination of their feudal
lord. The result was that, after some centuries, both parts
of Belgium were brought more and more closely together,
and from this resulted that much-needed political unity,
the only hope of a real independent Belgium.</p>

<p>The political history of the country in feudal times
(the tenth to the twelfth century) must now be examined.</p>

<p>Annexed to the German Empire, Lotharingia became
from 925 a sort of German province, especially during the
reign of Emperor Otto I (962), a man of powerful personality.
Otto clearly realized that no layman at the head
of Lotharingia would be loyal enough to submit entirely
to his own politics and he therefore appealed to the devotion
and faithfulness of the bishops. These were to be the
agents of the German influence and domination. In 953
Otto appointed his own brother, Bruno, as Duke of
Lotharingia and obtained for him at the same time the
archbishopric of Cologne. Having thus acquired control
of both the political and ecclesiastical power, Bruno became
the intermediary by whom not only the duchy but
also the Lotharingian church was to be more and more
Germanized.</p>

<p>However, the domination of the imperial German
church did not succeed in breaking entirely the resistance
of the local Lotharingian princes. Those princes had no
affection for the Emperor, their overlord; they could not
forget their old national dynasty, the Carolingians, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
belonged to the country and were not foreigners, as were
the German emperors. The people of Lotharingia supported
those local dynasties which claimed descent from
the old Carolingian national stock; the castles of the local
counts of Hainaut, Louvain, and Limburg became centers
of political influence, whose object was to check the domination
of the feudal German lord. Since the tenth century
the local houses of Hainaut and Louvain, of Namur
and Luxemburg, had attempted to organize their political
power. In the last quarter of the eleventh century, the
Germanization of Lotharingia broke down as a result of
the so-called “Struggle for the Investitures,” whereby the
power of the Emperor over the church in Germany was
destroyed. The bishops of the Empire, having to choose
between loyalty to their feudal lord and obedience to the
pope, were no longer political servants of the Emperor.
The downfall of the imperial church meant the end of its
influence in Lotharingia. The local princes threw off the
feudal yoke and practically divided the whole of Lotharingia
among themselves. And thus was witnessed the
end of that large imperial province that for so long had
covered the western frontier of Germany between the
Rhine and the Scheldt. We hear no more of Lotharingia:
another name appears in Belgian history, namely, Brabant.
It was the Duke of Brabant, of the local house of
Louvain, who, from this time on, gradually extended his
political influence over the former Lotharingia, in that
part of Belgium lying east of the Scheldt.</p>

<p>The German Emperor was now no more the lord of the
Lotharingian princes: he was henceforth regarded as an
ally or as an enemy, according to the circumstances. The
Lotharingian principalities no longer played a part in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
events occurring on the other side of the Rhine; they no
longer sent soldiers to the feudal imperial army; they
followed the emperors no more in their expeditions against
Italy; and, in the Lotharingian literature, there is to be
found hardly a suggestion of a recollection of the existence
of the Emperor.</p>

<p>From the middle of the twelfth century on, the national
life of the eastern part of Belgium displayed more and
more cohesion and individuality; little by little it broke
down the geographical barrier of the Scheldt that the
Treaty of Verdun had erected between Lotharingia and
Flanders.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the western part of Belgium, the county of
Flanders, had developed also in its own way. Assigned by
the Treaty of Verdun to the kingdom of France, Flanders
did not seek a separation from a country to which it was
geographically attached and on whose territory were to be
found the seats of its bishoprics and most of its monasteries.
The political power of the house of Flanders dates
from the time of Count Baldwin I, called Baldwin of the
Iron Arm (879), an adventurous ruler, who violently took
the daughter of the King of France, his lord, and made her
his wife, notwithstanding the vehement protest of her
royal father. That marriage brought to the count the
rich possessions of his wife and furnished to his heirs an
excellent pretext for meddling in the politics of France.
The kings of France at the time of the first counts of
Flanders were weaklings; moreover, the bishops of Noyon-Tournai,
Arras, and Térouanne were not as loyal to their
lord as those of Lotharingia were to the Emperor. The
political conditions were thus quite different in Flanders,
and at a time when the iron policy of Otto I and his heirs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
subdued the Lotharingian princes, the counts of Flanders
succeeded in developing their independence and political
influence without much opposition. Baldwin II (910)
enlarged his domain by conquering the wealthy regions of
Walloon-Flanders<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and Artois and formed an alliance with
England by marrying an Anglo-Saxon princess. Count
Arnulf (918) took the title of marquess and tried—though
vainly—to overpower the Duke of Normandy, who
checked his advance in the south and with it the extension
of Flemish conquest beyond the river Canche. Effectively
blocked in their efforts to extend their power in the
south, the Flemish counts next turned their attention to
the north and the east. Successively the islands of Zeeland,
the “Four Métiers,” and the county of Alost were
subjugated, although already under the feudal authority
of the German Empire. The result was that the Count of
Flanders became at once a vassal of the King of France
and of the German Emperor.</p>

<p>By the conquest of the county of Alost, Count Baldwin
V was enabled to cross the Scheldt and to advance into
Lotharingian territory. The marriage of his son with a
princess of Hainaut resulted in uniting both Flanders and
Hainaut under the same dynasty. Here again the barrier
erected by the Treaty of Verdun was broken down, and for
the first time political ties were established on both sides
of the Scheldt, between the two parts of Belgium.</p>

<p>Coincident with the first signs of a tendency to union
between Eastern and Western Belgium, Flanders began to
come into closer contact with foreign countries and powers.
As the daughter of Baldwin V was married to William
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy, many Flemish troops
took part in the conquest of England by the Normans
(1066), and these remained in the British Isles for purposes
of colonization. Diplomatic and commercial relations
between Flanders and England were the happy
result. Under Count Robert (1070), Flanders came into
contact with Denmark and with the court of Rome; a
pilgrimage to Jerusalem undertaken by Robert brought
him into touch with the Emperor of Constantinople, and
the Count of Flanders happened to be the first prince of
Europe to consider a crusade against the Turks.</p>

<p>In the twelfth century, however, the political expansion
of Flanders came to a standstill. To the weaklings of the
former period in France there had now succeeded kings of
stronger character, whose policy led them to subdue their
restless vassals and to centralize their own power. They
sought, therefore, to check the expansion of Flanders and
to dominate the powerful county, attaching it more closely
to the French domain. The road to the south was thus
no longer open for eventual conquest; the road to the
east also was barred by the Lotharingian princes. The
influence of the German Empire had practically disappeared
in Lotharingia. Brabant and Hainaut now
became the centers of a strong political life. It is a
curious phenomenon of history that, when Flanders was
threatened by the growing strength of France, Lotharingia
became practically independent of the influence of the
German Empire.</p>

<p>There was, therefore, as has been seen, no political unity
in Belgium during the feudal period: east and west each
developed in its own way and political conditions in each
section were very strongly influenced by their powerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
neighbors. There did exist, however, a common tendency
toward autonomy and freedom, Flanders trying to escape
from the influence of France and, to some extent, that of
England;<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Lotharingia struggling against the hegemony
of Germany. That tendency, it must be admitted, is not
a purely characteristic Belgian movement. At this period
the feudalists were everywhere to be found fighting against
the supremacy of the King and trying to win complete
political independence for themselves.</p>

<p>The one essentially Belgian factor in the diverging existence
of the east and the west, and which exerted a strong
influence in favor of unification, was the common social,
economic, and religious life.</p>

<p>A study of religious conditions in Belgium during the
tenth and eleventh centuries reveals, even more clearly
than a study of political events, the part played by both
Germany and France in imposing their respective practices,
and the ability of Belgium to incorporate and to
modify the best elements of Teutonic and Latin civilization.</p>

<p>After the Norman invasions of the ninth century, which
left Belgium covered with ruins and with many churches
and monasteries burned, or abandoned by their terrified
occupants, the ecclesiastical discipline suffered severely.
The old prescriptions of the Benedictine rule were no
longer observed and most of the monasteries became
dependents of powerful laymen.</p>

<p>In the tenth century a revival of the discipline followed,
thanks to the efforts of St. Gerard of Brogne, founder of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>the little monastery of Brogne, near Namur (923).
Gerard excited so much enthusiasm by the sanctity of his
life and the rigor of his discipline that princes and bishops
united in asking him to restore the practice of ascetic life
both in Lotharingia and in Flanders. The number of the
monasteries to the north of the linguistic barrier, especially
in Flanders, soon increased, whereas before they were
mainly to be found in Southern Belgium. Belgium became
a country of monasteries in the eleventh century,
and ever since that time the people have shown that deep
religious spirit that is one of the distinctive traits
of the national character. The monks exerted a very
strong influence on the minds of the rough feudalists, who
thought mainly of war and robbery: one of the most
powerful dukes of Lotharingia, Godefrid the Bearded,
desired to be buried in the dress of a monk. The robber-knights,
pursuing an enemy or a convoy of merchants,
thought only of plunder; once in sight of the walls of a
monastery, however, they would cease their pursuit and
turn back. Carrying through the country the relics of
their saints, the monks would often succeed in stopping
private wars and murder. An example of the religious
spirit is the great “procession” of Tournai, that attracted
every year thousands of pilgrims and visitors, Flemish
and Walloon together, and that acted as a unifying factor
for both races of Belgium.</p>

<p>The Reform of Cluny found the French and German
influence in serious conflict. The reform in question, by
which it was hoped to reintroduce a very severe discipline
in the monastic world, originated in French Burgundy
(1004) and soon spread through the northern countries,
especially in Flanders and Lotharingia. The monks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
of Cluny resolutely resented any interference of the
temporal power in religious affairs. As a result they
found themselves practically opposed to the system of
the imperial and feudal church of Germany, dominated
by the Emperor. The destruction of that system thus
meant indirectly the destruction of German influence in
Lotharingia. When the Struggle for the Investitures
broke out, the Lotharingian bishops hesitated at first, but
after a while nearly all of them took sides with the papal
cause against the Emperor. Both in matters of politics
and religion Lotharingia tended more and more to break
away from Germany.</p>

<p>Hitherto only one monastic order had influenced religious
life in Belgium, namely, the Benedictines. In the
twelfth century other orders were born—the Cistercians
and the Norbertins or Premontrés. The Cistercians,
founded by St. Bernard in France, played the part, mainly,
of clearers of wild land and of colonizers; they introduced
new economic and agricultural methods and exerted a
deep influence in economic life. The Premontrés were
canons, rather than monks, who passed their time in study
and in administering the parishes. But they, too, did
much for the colonization of the country, and they transformed
into fruit-bearing land the barren soil of the
Antwerp Campine.</p>

<p>The number of parishes increased in the course of the
tenth and eleventh centuries. New chapels were founded
in cases where the nearest parish church was too far
removed, or where a number of people sufficient for the
formation of a new parish were to be found dwelling close
together. Sometimes the establishment of a new parish
was ordered at the instance of a wealthy landlord, and a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>chapel constructed on the domain of his manor, in order
to gratify his desire for better opportunities for attending
church. Each chapel was ordinarily granted the right to
have its own parish priest, to whom was granted permission
to baptize infants and bury the dead in the parish
cemetery.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">THE CATHEDRAL OF TOURNAI</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As for the economic organization, in ante-feudal times
there existed an important difference between the country
south and that lying north of a line drawn through
Boulogne, Saint-Omer, Douai, Mons, and Maestricht.
North of this line we find the system of isolated farms;
south of the line the system of villages. But during the
tenth century the landlords extended their possessions in
farm lands as well as in the villages, and the same economic
organization, directed by the same principles, prevailed
throughout the country. Each domain was
divided into two parts: a central part, including the
manor of the landlord and that portion of the land exploited
by himself by means of unfree “serfs” or agricultural
laborers; and another part, surrounding the central
domain, divided into small lots, given to free farmers.</p>

<p>The domain of the ecclesiastical landlords, bishops or
abbots, was exceedingly well administered and the conditions
of life of the people depending upon these landlords
were very favorable; the ecclesiastical “serfs” frequently
asserted that they preferred their servitude to freedom,
as less burdensome than freedom itself. The ecclesiastical
“serfs” were grouped in families, <i>familiae</i>, within whose
limits justice was administered by the mayor of the community
in the name of the abbot.</p>

<p>The lay landlords, on the other hand, were bad administrators.
Dealing only with politics and war, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
ignored agricultural problems; they did not come into
contact with their laborers, and they left with their officers,
<i>ministeriales</i>, the care of ruling and judging their servants.
They preferred attendance at “tournaments,” which
might be regarded as a sort of military training and as a
means of learning the profession of bearer of arms. They
undertook long and distant journeys in order to fight
the knights of Vermandois, Champagne, and Picardy in
France. And as a result both Walloons and Flemings
came in contact with their French brethren in arms.</p>

<p>The upper landlords, the dukes and counts, gave much
attention, however, to the colonization and the economic
improvement of the country. Northern and Western
Flanders and Northern Brabant were covered with sandy
soil and marshes, and thick woods were to be found in
some parts as late as the end of the eleventh century. In
the early part of that century, the counts of Flanders
began to engage the unemployed for agricultural purposes.
They turned the unproductive parts of the country
into fertile meadows, suitable for pasturing cattle.
Canals and dykes were constructed in order to increase the
productivity of the soil. In the course of the twelfth century
a sturdy populace of land laborers was attracted into
Germany by the landlords of the countries of Bremen,
Holstein, Thuringia, and Silesia. It was the Flemings
and the people of Brabant who colonized the right bank
of the river Elbe and who turned the marshes of Eastern
Germany into fertile soil. Many villages still remind us
today of those Flemings, and are still known as <i>Flämingdörfer</i>.</p>

<p>On the Flemish seacoast the people were engaged in
raising cattle, especially sheep and cows; another large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
element was employed in herring and cod fishing in
the North Sea. These people were mostly of Frisian or
Saxon origin; they were not descendants of the Franks.
They spoke another language; they had other customs and
laws; they were socially free men. When the French
influence increased in Flanders, they alone retained their
Germanic characteristics, and it was among them, in the
fourteenth century, that were found the fiercest opponents
of France.</p>

<p>As affecting the artistic life of Belgium in the tenth and
eleventh centuries, we find the same influences at work
which have been mentioned as operative in political and
religious spheres. The Romance and Germanic ideas were
absorbed, mixed, and transformed by the Belgian artists
of that time.</p>

<p>Lotharingia, the eastern part of Belgium, possessed, of
course, no cathedrals comparable with those of Worms,
Speyer, and Mainz. However, the literary movement
developed by the Lotharingian bishops was accompanied
by an artistic revival. As most of the Lotharingian
bishops were of German descent, the direction of the work
was intrusted to German architects. The oldest examples
of romantic architecture in the regions of the Meuse reveal
German influence. Not only the architects, but also the
sculptors, the painters, etc., were Germans, though sometimes
recourse was had to Italian artists, who came
over the Alps to seek their fortunes. The frescoes on the
walls of St. James’s Church at Liège are the work of a
painter called Giovanni.</p>

<p>The Lotharingian artists soon began to imitate the
German methods and to use material native to the country.
Supplies for walls and columns were no longer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
brought from Germany, but from the valley of the Meuse.
Until the twelfth century, German traditions, however,
prevailed in architecture, and at no time prior to the
beginning of that period can there be said to have been
any Lotharingian style.</p>

<p>If the valley of the Meuse was the artistic center of
Eastern Belgium, in the western part of the country—in
Flanders—it was the city of Tournai which dominated
artistic development. The cathedral of Tournai, the only
large Romance basilica of Belgium, rivals the cathedrals of
the Rhine in majesty and harmony of form. The plan
reveals the work of an architect influenced by the German
school. But in the architectural details are to be found
motifs inspired by the large French cathedrals of Normandy.
The double German and French influence resulted
in the founding of a local school of architecture
at Tournai, which exhibited great activity throughout
Flanders. Tournai, the religious capital of Flanders, became
also the artistic capital. The stone of Tournai was
famous. Thanks to the Scheldt, material was easily transported,
and in the locality where it was used it was, of
course, architects of Tournai who drew the plans of the
buildings. There existed also at Tournai a local school of
sculptors, whose members were very active and who may
be regarded as true artists.</p>

<p>There remains only the literary life in both parts of
Belgium during the feudal period to be considered.</p>

<p>Dating from the ninth century, there were many to be
found among the ecclesiastics and the upper classes who
spoke both languages, Romance and Teutonic, equally well.
In the monasteries Flemish and Walloon monks lived
together, and in the Abbey of St. Amand, in Southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
Belgium, there has been found, written by the same hand,
the oldest poem of French literature, the <i>Cantilène de Ste.
Eulalie</i>, and also one of the oldest products of Teutonic
literature, the <i>Ludwigslied</i>. The bishops and abbots
knew both languages; the abbots of Lobbes, a Walloon
monastery in the tenth century, spoke both Flemish and
French. In the diocese of Térouanne (later Saint-Omer)
the bishops were obliged to know “barbarian,” i.e., the
Teutonic language. During the eleventh century, many
preachers were able to address the people of the Walloon
and Flemish sections, and abbots who knew both languages
were preferred. The lay princes were obliged at
least to understand Walloon and Flemish, for Flanders,
Brabant, and Limburg included people of both races.
When the army of the crusaders started for the Holy Land,
the Lotharingian prince Godfrid of Bouillon was appointed
as their leader, because, according to the chronicle of Otto
von Freising, “brought up on the frontier of the Romance
and the Teutonic people, he knew both languages equally
well.” During the twelfth century, the knowledge of
French was regarded as a necessary element of perfect
culture. On the common people, however, French civilization
had no influence at all; they knew and spoke only
Flemish.</p>

<p>The French influence was especially strong from a
linguistic point of view; the German influence was overwhelming
in the literary domain, especially in Lotharingia.
The bishops were, generally speaking, the sole
possessors of literary and scientific culture, and in Lotharingia
most of them were strongly Germanized. The
center of literary life in Lotharingia was the school of
Liège, founded by the Saxon bishop Everachar. It became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
a center of study, where not only Germans, but also
French, English, and Slav students were to be found.
The curriculum of the school, known as the school of St.
Lambert, included grammar, rhetoric, poetry, music,
mathematics, and theology. This institution was the
means by which many new ideas were circulated through
France and Germany, as its teachers were in close touch
with all the scientific tendencies of the time. In Western
and Southern Belgium we find the influence of the school
of Cambrai as paramount. Although a Romance region,
Cambrai belonged to the German Empire, and was therefore
a center of German influence. The dominating <i>genre</i>
in literature is history, and that is an especially Belgian
<i>genre</i>; history has always been much cultivated in Belgium.
The historical work of a monk, Sigebert of Gembloux,
is recognized as the center of that activity.</p>

<p>The Struggle for the Investitures, which destroyed the
power and the influence of the German imperial and feudal
church from a political and religious point of view, destroyed
also its influence in literary life. The schools of
Liège were abandoned and, from the first quarter of the
twelfth century on, students turned their eyes toward
Paris.</p>

<p>In Flanders, literary influence, as was the case with
artistic movements, was French rather than German.
Tournai, the artistic capital, was also the intellectual
center, and Tournai was a Romance bishopric. The
school of St. Mary had only French teachers and contributed
in spreading a knowledge of the French language
among the Flemish clergy. Essentially theological and
dialectical, however, the teaching of St. Mary was less
important than the teaching of St. Lambert of Liège.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span></p>

<p>Thus, during the tenth and eleventh centuries, the
civilization of Belgium was influenced by the culture of
its powerful neighbors. Nevertheless, the elements of
German and French civilization were not simply absorbed;
they were transformed, adapted, and nationalized, and
became a real part of the life of the nation.</p>

<p class="center">THE RISE AND INFLUENCE OF THE COMMUNES</p>

<p>A new epoch opens with the twelfth century in the
history of Belgium. The era is frequently called the
“Time of the Communes,” because the internal political
life of the country, from then on, was dominated by the
development of the free cities (communes) and of their
municipal institutions. And it has been said that “in
the part played by the cities since the twelfth century lies
the best of the history of the Netherlands.”</p>

<p>Until the rise of the communes, only two classes of
people, the noblemen and the priests, were given any
recognition. There remained, of course, the peasant
farmers, but they had no political or social power. After
the twelfth century, a new class sprang into existence—the
burgesses (<i>bourgeois, burgers</i>), the citizens of the free
cities—and the rise of that class exerted a tremendous
influence on the political and social development of the
nation. To the tyranny of feudalism it opposed the
spirit of personal and collective freedom, and the social
construction of the nation was materially influenced by
the introduction of the new elements it represented.</p>

<p>The origin and development of the communes was
mainly due to economic conditions: the Belgian cities
of the Middle Ages were the daughters of trade and
industry.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp49" id="i_b_036fp" style="max-width: 22.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_036fp.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">THE BELFRY OF GHENT <br>On the right the Town Hall</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Beginning with the eleventh century many signs
indicated a complete revival of trade, which had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>nearly annihilated by the internecine struggles and the
invasion of the Normans during the ninth century. At
the end of the tenth century Flanders was already in
touch with the Arab merchants trading in the Baltic;
coins of the counts of Flanders are to be found in Denmark,
Prussia, and Russia. The merchants of that time
were traveling merchants, going from one town to another,
and never remaining permanently in any one spot. All
along the rivers wharves were established for discharging
goods and wares, as well as winter quarters for the traders
for the period during which the rivers were frozen. These
were to be found at Valenciennes, Cambrai, Ghent on
the Scheldt, Dinant, Huy, Liège, and Maestricht on the
Meuse. Bruges became a central meeting-place for
Flemish, Walloon, German, Frisian, and Anglo-Saxon
merchants, and between the Scheldt and the Thames
commercial intercourse was frequent. Little by little
there grew up a special class who depended for a living on
sale and purchase. A man became a merchant just as
another became a knight, a priest, or a farmer. All
those without land, the discontented “serfs” who succeeded
in escaping from the domain to which they were
attached, steadily augmented this early nucleus of the
merchant class.</p>

<p>The invasion of England by William the Conqueror
(1066) and the large numbers of the Flemings who participated
in it strengthened the economic ties between
that country and Flanders, between London and Bruges.
In Bruges<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> vessels from all parts of Europe were loaded
with cargoes for London: wine from France and Germany,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>stone from Tournai, cloth of gold and groceries sent by
the merchants of Lombardy, wool and linen cloths manufactured
in Flanders. The prosperity of the Flemish
trade attracted the representatives of European commerce;
fairs and yearly markets were established at
Thourout, Messines, Lille, Ypres, and Douai.</p>

<p>Along with trade came the development of industry.
On the Belgian coast the sheep-raising industry goes back
as far as the early days of Roman occupation; woolen
cloths were a special manufacture of the region. The
more extensive the “polders”—the meadows wrested from
the sea—became, the more the number of sheep raised
on them increased, and consequently also the number
of people connected with the wool industry. As trade
developed the conditions of that industry, more and more
people found occupation in the manufacture of woolen
cloths. A special class of craftsmen was born. They
deserted the countryside and settled down in the neighborhood
of the merchants; trade and industry attracted
each other. Flanders then became the seat of the cloth
industry.</p>

<p>Another kind of industry was in process of development
in Eastern Belgium, in the valley of the Upper Meuse.
This was a mountainous region, filled with copper and tin
mines along the banks of the river between Huy and
Dinant. Here was developed a metal industry, whose
products were shipped out on the river Meuse. After
the tenth century the native mines were no longer sufficient
for the needs of the country; the population of Huy
and Dinant supplied its needs from the mines of Goslar
in Germany. The products of the copper and tin industry
were exported to France and England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span></p>

<p>Brabant, the central part of Belgium, remained for
a long time purely agricultural. In the middle of the
twelfth century, however, a highroad was constructed between
Cologne and Bruges, passing through Maestricht,
Saint-Trond, Léau, Louvain, Brussels, Alost, and Ghent.
Trade now flowed, not only from south to north by the
Scheldt and the Meuse, but also from east to west along
the new commercial road.</p>

<p>This remarkable development of trade and industry
was mainly responsible for the origin and growth of the
communes. Of course, for many centuries episcopal
residences (<i>civitates</i>), castles and manors (<i>castra</i>), churches
and monasteries had been centers of civilization and
an attraction for the population of the neighborhood.
And under the protection of their walls were grouped
many wealthy villages. The latter, however, would
probably never have developed into cities except for the
presence of a colony of merchants and craftsmen. These
colonies established themselves in neighborhoods where
they could find favorable conditions for trading as well as
protection for their commerce. Naturally, therefore,
they settled in the vicinity of castles and convents (the
castles affording military and the convents moral protection),
at the confluence of two or more rivers, along a
commercial highroad, in the curve of a gulf, or at the
mouth of a stream. In this manner the cities of Bruges,
Ghent, Brussels, Louvain, Liège, Malines, etc., were born,
for it is an interesting point of Belgian history that nearly
all the cities originated during the Middle Ages, very
few of them dating back to the Roman times. Those
colonies of merchants and craftsmen grouped together
in professional and religious associations were called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
“guilds,” and introduced an entirely new spirit among
the people of the growing town. The unfree population
dependent upon the convent, the church, or the castle
had no means of changing its conditions of life, bound as
it was by the numerous ties of feudal and other obligations.
But the traders had to secure for themselves a certain
degree of liberty, safety, and autonomy. The feudal
régime or the rules of the manor were intolerable to them.
The operation of the system was too tyrannous; it acted
too much as a restraint on private liberty and would
have rendered the free development of commercial and
industrial enterprises impossible.</p>

<p>The guilds, therefore, formerly purely professional
associations, soon began to meddle in politics and to
become political organizations as well. Their members
discussed in their guild-halls, built for their business
meetings, the changes desired in the existing social,
economic, and political conditions of the community,
and carried on propaganda in support of their demands.</p>

<p>At the same time the members of the guilds began to
build walls around the settlement, in order to protect the
new city against attack from the outside. Such a fortified
town was called <i>burgus</i>, <i>bourg</i>, “borough,” and the
inhabitants were called <i>burgenses, bourgeois</i>, “burgesses.”</p>

<p>When the burgesses began to work for changes in the
existing régime of the territory in which the town had
developed, the princes and landlords to which that territory
belonged naturally showed opposition. In some
cases they resisted the demands of the guild, but the
people were frequently induced to rebel and, by a revolutionary
method, to wrest from their overlords the rights
they demanded. In most cases the princes recognized the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
justice of the claims and granted the burgesses a new
law, better suited to the needs of commerce and industry.
This new law, the city law, different from the feudal law
and the law of the manor, was called <i>Keure</i> in Flemish,
<i>charte de commune</i> in French. It contained the political,
social, and financial privileges granted by the landlord and
the prince to the burgesses. When the city law was
granted, the commune came into existence. One of
the most important privileges of the commune was a
special tribunal, called <i>échevinage, schepenhank</i>, composed
of citizens and presided over by an officer appointed by
the lord.</p>

<p>The commune possessed political and judicial autonomy
and its inhabitants were personally free. A man from a
neighboring country or a foreigner who had dwelt in the
city for one year and one day became a burgess and
enjoyed all the privileges of citizenship. Although
politically autonomous, the commune still owed certain
obligations to its lord. These were mainly an oath of
allegiance and the duty of assisting the lord with its army
of citizens. This latter duty sometimes created curious
situations. At the battle of the Golden Spurs in 1302,
when King Philip IV of France was defeated by the
Flemish communists, the inhabitants of Louvain fought
on the side of the French King against their Flemish
brethren, because their lord, the Duke of Brabant, was a
partisan of Philip.</p>

<p>Although the commune owed certain duties to the
lord, it had also, as a politically autonomous body, some
important rights: the right to have a special seal to be
appended to the official documents issued by the commune;
the right to build a city hall and a belfry, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
belfry being a tower, usually erected in the market-place,
where the bell that called the burgesses to arms
was hung, and where the archives of the city were carefully
kept in iron safes. As the commune exercised the
right of life and death over its members, it erected as
symbols of that right the pillory and the gallows, generally
at the gate or outside the city wall.</p>

<p>The development of the communes was not quite the
same in the various sections of Belgium. In the principality
of Liège, the cities of Dinant, Huy, and Saint-Trond
obtained their privileges sooner than Liège itself. The
charter of freedom for Huy dates from 1066. In the
ecclesiastical principality of Cambrai the commune was
established by violently revolutionary means in 1077.
The merchants of Cambrai suffered from the tyranny of
the officers appointed by the bishops, and a conspiracy was
organized. On a certain day when Bishop Gerard left
the town, the citizens ran to arms, under the leadership
of the prominent merchants, and proclaimed the commune.
But the bishop returned unexpectedly and his
knights killed many of the people and pillaged the houses
of the leaders. The supremacy of the bishop was restored
for a long period.</p>

<p>In Flanders, the counts were sincere protectors of the
communes; they regarded them as a mighty resource of
their treasury and early recognized the claims of the
<i>mercatores</i>. From the end of the eleventh century the
main demands contained in the propaganda of the guilds
were accepted and special privileges were granted to the
cities. From the time of Count Charles the Good (1119-27),
each city had its own <i>échevins</i> (sheriffs), chosen from
among the burgesses; the president alone, the <i>bailli</i>, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
an officer of the lord, and responsible only to him. The
house of the counts of Alsace (1128) owed its accession
to the communes and therefore protected the cities in a
special manner. They gave to all of them the same
municipal charter, a copy of the charter of Arras, and
both the Flemish and the Walloon communes of Flanders
enjoyed identically the same privileges.</p>

<p>In the duchy of Brabant, the communes developed
more slowly, owing to the fact that conditions for the
development of trade and industry were not so much
advanced here. From the time when the commercial
highroad between Cologne and Bruges was constructed
the municipal movement was participated in more
actively by the princes. Here, also, the princes came
to assume the same sympathetic attitude as in Flanders,
but there was no general organization granting the same
type of constitution for all the cities. The privileges
of each city were recognized and granted separately.</p>

<p>The existence of the communes exerted a powerful
influence on the internal politics of the feudal lords of
Belgium. The latter were forced to take the communes
more and more into account and to change their political
attitude in accordance with the wishes of the burgesses.
The knights, almost ruined by the decline of the value of
the land, rendered military service only when paid for it.
The feudal troops were no longer sufficient in numbers.
The princes were obliged to seek the aid of the cities, to
beg for taxes in order to pay the loans they were now
obliged to contract for the allowances of the mercenary
troops which they were compelled to hire. The princes
no longer governed alone; they had to respect and
cultivate the friendship of the cities. Their subjects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
began to take part in the political combinations of the
feudalists. As a matter of fact, war was no longer
possible without the consent of the communes, and it
resulted, therefore, that the burgesses, if in disagreement
with their lord, instead of assisting him, appealed to
foreign rulers and fought against their own prince. It
may be said that, owing to these changes in political life,
the communes had succeeded in breaking the régime of
feudalism. This may be cited as a supreme instance of
their importance in Belgian history.</p>

<p>No less important was the influence they exerted—mainly
during the thirteenth century—in the development
of the economic, industrial, social, intellectual, and artistic
life of the country. During that period trade and
industry were essentially prominent in the life of the
people. On account of their excellent location, the Belgian
seaports became the meeting-places of vessels from
the North Sea, the Baltic, the Mediterranean, the Orient.
Ever since the existence of the commercial highroad
between Cologne and Bruges the trade of the former had
declined more and more. Given a shorter route by land,
it is, generally speaking, that which is selected by merchants
by which to forward their goods. Ghent became
the center of commercial relations between Flanders and
Germany, and many privileges were granted to Ghent
tradesmen. Antwerp also grew little by little into an
important commercial center, being connected with the
Cologne-Bruges road by means of the Scheldt, that joins
that road at Ghent.</p>

<p>Bruges, however, remained the commercial metropolis.
It was in direct contact with the sea. Located midway
between the Sunt and the straits of Gibraltar, it stored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
goods arriving from the north and from the south. A
new harbor was constructed at Damme and connected
with Bruges by a canal, whose powerful moles have been
immortalized by Dante in his <i>Divina <span class="err" title="original: Comedia">Commedia</span></i>.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The
market-place at Bruges was crowded as much as was
the Piazza San Marco in Venice. Toward the middle of the
thirteenth century Bruges was enjoying trade relations
with England, Normandy, Gascony, Spain, Provence,
and the Hanseatic cities. In the fourteenth century
the development of the harbor reached its climax by the
organization of a regular transport service between the
Flemish port and Genoa and Venice.</p>

<p>The growth of Flemish commerce was increased by
the liberal free exchange policy of the counts of Flanders,
especially since the time of Baldwin IX (1202). There
was no taking advantage of foreign trade, no heavy taxes,
no stringent customs. Many privileges were granted
to the “Osterlings,” the merchants from Germany. If a
war broke out between Flanders and a Hanseatic city, the
Osterlings were allowed a period of three months in which
to leave the country and to put their belongings in safety.
The same privileges were granted to merchants from
Poitou, Gascony, and Spain.</p>

<p>Necessarily, also, Bruges became a center of financial
operations: pawnbrokers from Cahors, Lombardy, Florence,
and Sienna flocked to the city in large numbers and
soon monopolized all credit operations. The Lombardic
pawnbrokers, especially, invaded the whole country
between the Meuse and the sea, and it is an astonishing
fact that in small cities like Léau (in the neighborhood of
Louvain) branch offices of the mighty banking houses
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>of Paris were to be found. The important part played
by the circulation of money is also proved by the many
coin reforms of that time. The Belgian coins, owing to
their excellence and high standard, were imitated in
Germany by the Hanseatic cities.</p>

<p>At the time of the communes manufacture was even
more important than trade. The Belgian provinces
became essentially an industrial country: from Douai to
Saint-Trond there is not a city which was not connected
with the cloth industry. Belgian textures became unequaled
in suppleness, delicacy, and beauty of color;
they were to be found everywhere throughout Europe,
and were exported even to the bazaars of the Orient by
vessels from Venice, Marseilles, and Barcelona. It is in
the south of Flanders that the art of dyeing seems to have
reached the highest perfection. Ypres, Douai, with its
famous <i>écarlate</i>, and Arras are especially entitled to
mention in this particular. The cloth industry was soon
introduced farther north, in Ghent and Bruges, and also
in Brabant. Brussels, Malines, and Louvain early rivaled
the Flemish cities.</p>

<p>The annexation of Walloon Flanders by France deprived
the Flemish cloth industry of one of its sources
of raw material, and it became necessary to obtain it
from England. Since that time Flanders and England
have been naturally dependent on each other and in this
fact is to be found the reason for the close alliance between
these countries, from a political point of view, especially
in the fourteenth century. The commercial relations
between Flanders and England were monopolized by a
powerful association of wool importers, the Hansa of
London, composed of Flemish tradesmen. After a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>while the cloth industry developed to such an extent that
the supply of English wool was no longer sufficient: wool
from Spain and Navarre was also employed.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp49" id="i_b_047fp" style="max-width: 22.9375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_047fp.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">THE COLLEGIATE CHURCH OF SAINT GUDULA, BRUSSELS</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Aside from the territory in which the cloth industry
flourished, Belgium possessed also an agricultural region,
far less developed, of which Hainaut was the center.
Here the cities were merely large villages: Mons, Binche,
and Ath cannot be compared with the cities of Flanders
and Brabant. Namur and Luxemburg also were merely
agricultural regions with no more than 8,000 and 5,000
population, respectively; whereas Ghent and Bruges had a
populace of no less than 80,000, at least at the climax of
their development.</p>

<p>In the valley of the Meuse, cities like Saint-Trond and
Huy, where the cloth industry flourished in smaller
degree, were unable to rival those of Flanders. The
city of Dinant, on the Meuse, which, as stated before, was,
from the end of the tenth century, engaged in the copper
industry, may be singled out. The products of Dinant,
called <i>dinanderie</i>, were exported throughout Europe.
The merchants of Dinant had a storehouse in London
and were members of the Hanseatic Association.</p>

<p>Finally, there remains the city of Liège in Eastern
Belgium. This was a city of priests, the residence of the
bishop-prince. It was filled with churches, convents, and
chapels. The land was owned largely by religious communities.
But the priests were more numerous than
the burgesses.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> There was no thought here of industry
until the end of the Middle Ages, when this part of the
country became the seat of collieries and ironworks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span></p>
<p>Under the influence of such commercial and industrial
conditions as we have recited, the life of the country
people and the control of the soil were entirely transformed.
After the twelfth century the old agricultural
régime broke down and servitude became an exception;
generally speaking, the peasant was thenceforward a
free man, like the burgess. This important change came
in connection with the crisis introduced by the new economic
conditions of the twelfth century. At this time
the value of money decreased rapidly and both the
ecclesiastical and lay landlords found themselves threatened
with bankruptcy. The methods of the old economic
organization had to be changed if ruin was to be averted.
New methods, therefore, were introduced by the Cistercian
monks. The houses of this monastic order were very
numerous at the beginning of the twelfth century; they
constituted a class of an entirely new type. Most of their
establishments were located among the marshes and
heaths, which they were obliged to convert into fertile
soil. For that work the monks alone were insufficient;
they needed the help of so-called lay-brethren, who cultivated
and fertilized the land. Round the monasteries
themselves they established large farms, which became
centers of new agricultural methods. The raising of
cattle and the culture of corn were now their main business,
and the crops were not merely intended for the consumption
of the convent but a large part was sent to market
to be sold. The peasants employed for this work were
no longer “serfs,” but free workers coming from outside.
Servitude did not exist on the territory owned by the
Cistercians. The monks soon became wealthy capitalists,
but they utilized their means in clearing the heaths of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
the Campine, the forests of Hainaut, and in creating the
“polders” of the Flemish coast. At the end of the
thirteenth century the clearing of the land was finished
and the farms and “polders” were rented out to free
farmers. That system was likewise followed by the other
monastic orders, and the class of free farmers soon grew
more and more numerous. The example given by the
Cistercians was followed by laymen. A large part of
Brabant, Hainaut, Flanders, and Namur was covered
with heaths, woods, and marshes. The dukes and counts,
seeing what had been accomplished, began to order this
wild land to be cleared. Along with the clearing of the
soil came the foundation of new cities. The Belgian cities
whose names contain the suffix <i>-sart</i>, <i>-rode</i>, or <i>-kerke</i><a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> date
from this time. In order to get workers enough for clearing
the land, the princes sought to attract them by granting
special privileges, such as complete personal freedom and
cession of land subject to a very small payment. A new
type of peasant was born in Flanders—the peasant who
was a freeman and who also owned his land. The
peasants of Hainaut, Namur, and Ardennes were, of
course, less in touch with the modern spirit; the different
commercial and industrial conditions operated to keep
them longer in servitude. Since the thirteenth century
most of the Belgian peasants have been free, whereas in
Germany servitude appeared even at the end of the
Middle Ages.</p>

<p>As to the literary life and the respective positions of the
French and Flemish languages at this time, the next
chapter, which deals with the political conditions of
Belgium in the period of the communes, will show the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>increasing influence of France, both in Flanders and in
Brabant. It will not be surprising, therefore, to find
that France exercised an influence upon Belgium from a
literary and artistic point of view also. Flanders, a fief
of France, was the first to feel that influence, and to feel
it in a greater degree than any other Belgian principality.
As a spoken language, French made a strong advance
in the thirteenth century, albeit the conquest was a peaceful
one. The wealthy communes of French or Walloon
Flanders, like Arras, became real centers of French literature
and culture. The Cistercians spread the knowledge
of French in the monasteries, their order being originally
French. The aristocracy also took part in the movement,
following the example of the princes. The counts were
all of Romance descent. The house of Alsace came from
France; Baldwin VIII and Baldwin IX were Walloons;
the countesses Jeanne and Marguerite were educated in
Paris; the counts of the house of Dampierre came originally
from Champagne. The language of the court as
well as the language officially used was French. The
wealthy burgesses sought to imitate the noblemen, and it
was necessary for the merchants to know French to enable
them to visit the fairs of Champagne.</p>

<p>However, we know that some of the commercial acts
were written in Flemish. Flemish was overwhelmingly
the popular tongue in Ghent and Bruges, and public
officers were obliged to know and speak it, as well as
French and Latin. As before, the common people
remained faithful to the Flemish language; it was the
only one they spoke. Flemish was also the principal language
spoken in Brabant. Here the dukes strongly resisted
French political hegemony, and Brabant remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
the most independent Belgian province. French was, of
course, made use of by the dukes in their private and
domestic affairs, but Flemish prevailed in all their relations
with their subjects; it was the language used by
public officers. If the aristocracy was Gallicized, it was
merely a matter of custom and <i>bon ton</i>.</p>

<p>As to the Romance literary movement, its productions
were to be found in those regions where trade and industry
tended to the increase of wealth. Luxemburg did not
produce anything and Liège very little; in the latter city,
moreover, the persons in the entourage of the bishop were
largely German or Flemish. Romance literature flourished
in Flanders, Brabant, and Hainaut; it was written
in Picard, the original dialect that the writers themselves
preferred, in opposition, so to speak, to French. The
literature in question consisted partly of translations into
the vernacular of Latin works written on science, partly of
historical productions, and partly of poetry. The historical
<i>genre</i> was much cultivated, but was more and more limited
to castles and convents. Although the burgesses of the
communes, eager to know as much as possible, found
interest and pleasure in the historical writers (and it may
be pointed out that the valuable chronicle of Philip
Mousket was composed, about 1240, for the townspeople
of Tournai), the citizens of the communes preferred the
new <i>genre</i> introduced in literature, the <i>poésie bourgeoise</i>,
wherein animals played a large part as personages; the
<i>épopée</i> of <i>Rinehart the Fox</i> is particularly famous.</p>

<p>The rich development of Romance literature in Flanders
and Hainaut prevented to some extent the early
birth of an original and independent Flemish literature.
Flemish literature had modest origins: it consisted at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
first merely of translations from the French, but it is
highly interesting to note that it was through the intermediary
of Flemish translations that French productions
were introduced into Germany. The <i>Legend of Saint
Servais</i> and the <i>Enéide</i>, composed by the Flemish knight,
Hendrik Van Veldeke, following Latin sources, enjoyed
an immense success and were promptly imitated in
Germany. The French version of <i>Rinehart the Fox</i>
was adapted in Flemish by a certain William, who surpassed
his model, localized the story to the neighborhood
of Ghent and the country of Waes, and gave to his work a
real Flemish color.</p>

<p>The spirit of the Flemish burgesses, ordinarily inclined
to be jeering and satirical, nevertheless inspired the greatest
poet of thirteenth-century Flemish literature, Jacob
Van Maerlandt, called “the father of all the Flemish
poets.” He founded in Flanders the didactical <i>genre</i>,
adapted to the practical and sensible character of the
nation. His object was to give to laymen access to
the knowledge hitherto monopolized by the clergymen.
His writings were in the field of natural history, politics
and ethics, and sacred and profane history. He enjoyed
great success and achieved the honor of seeing his works
translated into French. Maerlandt, although he seemed
to despise the French poets because he found their work
too frivolous, was not a political writer. His greatness
lay in the fact that he exercised a decisive influence on
Flemish culture. He brought the Flemish language to
the rank of a really literary language and developed it
into an instrument capable of expressing the national
genius. The soul of Flanders lives in Maerlandt’s
poems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span></p>

<p>There yet remains to be considered the artistic development
during the early period of the communes. French
influence was prominent in the thirteenth century in the
southern and western parts of the country. Tournai, of
course, remained the artistic center of Flanders, and it was
through Tournai that Gothic art was introduced into
Belgium, just as Romantic art had earlier been introduced
through Liège. The new choir of the cathedral of
Tournai (<i>ca.</i> 1250) is remarkably French in its plan and
methods of construction. But, on the whole, the school
of Tournai does not merely copy the French style. It
possesses its own originality; its type is full of charm and
elegance. Its influence, thanks to the use so frequently
made of the stone of Tournai, is overwhelming in Flanders,
especially in Ghent and Bruges and in Hainaut.</p>

<p>Brabant, on the other hand, has a style of its own,
owing to the fact that it uses its own local materials,
found in its numerous quarries. There is a wide difference
between the style of St. John’s Church at Ghent and St.
Gudula’s Church at Brussels, although their choirs are
nearly contemporaneous. In the course of the fifteenth
century the school of Brabant became dominant.</p>

<p>In another region—that part of Flanders near the sea
and known as “maritime Flanders”—stone from Tournai
was not used because of the difficulty of access, and here
there is also to be found an independence of style. There
brick was made use of in place of stone, and, although
the inspiration of the architecture came from Tournai,
the style of that school underwent some change, owing
to the difference in the materials employed. The houses
of Bruges reveal the ornaments in brick peculiar to that
style.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span></p>

<p>An entirely rich and original style, a sign of the power
and the wealth of the communes, is to be found in the civic
monuments, particularly the town halls. Everyone is
familiar with the hall of Bruges and the magnificent hall
of Ypres, a gem of beauty. With their wonderful belfries,
their wide rooms, and the vast proportions of the edifices
themselves, they symbolize in a wonderful manner the
strength, the pride, and the glory of the Belgian cities in
the Middle Ages.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE POLITICS AND STRUGGLES OF THE TIME
OF THE COMMUNES</p>

<p>A consideration of the politics of the Belgian dukes
and counts during the course of the twelfth and the thirteenth
centuries leads to a division of this epoch into two
periods. During the twelfth century a policy of maintaining
a balance between their mighty neighbors, France,
England, and the Empire, was pursued. At the beginning
of the thirteenth century France gained the hegemony
in Europe, and the Belgian princes were forced to submit
to the strong influence of that country.</p>

<p>In the first quarter of the twelfth century the Struggle
for the Investitures had destroyed German influence in
the eastern part of Belgium. The influence of the
emperors was on the wane. One of the most loyal of the
partisans of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, the Count
of Hainaut, succeeded in remaining neutral during the
war between Germany and France. The Count declared
that “he was not obliged to put his fortresses in the hands
of the imperial troops and to grant them passage through
his territory, as that would bring devastation to his
country. His country being located between Germany
and France, he ought to remain neutral during this war.”</p>

<p>The unsympathetic attitude of the Lotharingian princes
toward Germany, however, was not dictated by anything
like national hostility or racial prejudice, for the Flemish
principalities, with their inhabitants of Germanic descent,
were as unfriendly as the Walloon principalities. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
indifference, rather, for the Lotharingian princes had no
interests in common with the Empire. They went their
own way and had little regard for the Emperor. The
social and economic development of the country between
the Scheldt and the Meuse likewise prevented the people
of that region from sympathizing with Germany. The
culture of Germany, at this time a purely agricultural
country, was far behind the culture of the Belgian principalities.
The Lotharingian princes turned their eyes
toward Flanders, with which they enjoyed important
commercial relations. On the other hand, the counts of
Flanders had sought, ever since the reign of Thierry of
Alsace (1168), to interfere with the countries across the
Scheldt and to meddle in the politics of Holland, Brabant,
Hainaut, Namur, Gueldre, and even Liège. Henceforth
the Belgian principalities, having common political and
economic interests, will be found to have an increasingly
common history. Thanks to its relations with Flanders,
Lotharingia now began to come into contact with France
and England.</p>

<p>Flanders, at this time, was very powerful. In 1163
Count Philip of Alsace had occupied, in the name of his
wife, the French counties of Vermandois, Amiénois, and
Valois, and had become the first vassal of the French
crown. But at that moment the throne of France was
occupied by a king of very strong personality, who himself
directed the government of France and who had
decided to destroy the power of his restless vassals. That
king was Philip August. He directed his efforts especially
against Flanders. He is quoted as having once
said: “France will absorb Flanders or will be destroyed
by it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span></p>

<p>It was in vain that Count Philip of Alsace sought to
win the support of the German Emperor. Having failed
on this side, he turned to England for help against the
threatening policy of his overlord. This was a highly
important event (1187), for from that time on it became
the constant policy of Flanders to keep England as an
ally against France.</p>

<p>When Philip of Alsace died suddenly during the siege
of Saint Jean d’Acre by the Crusaders, June 1, 1191,
Philip August regarded this as a favorable opportunity
to annex the county. He was prevented from doing so,
however, by the action of the Count of Hainaut, Baldwin
V, brother-in-law of the late Flemish count, who invaded
Flanders and succeeded in bringing about the political
union of the two counties. The county of Artois, however,
refused to enter the union, and returned to Philip
August. The latter hoped that, as Baldwin V (IX in
Flanders) had only two daughters as his heirs, it would
be easy to dispose of a strong political influence in the
country after the death of Baldwin. Accordingly he
brought about the marriage of Jeanne of Flanders, the
eldest daughter of Baldwin,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> to one of his creatures, Ferrand
of Portugal. Henceforth he considered that Flanders
would be in his hands. Subsequent events, however,
were to prove his mistake.</p>

<p>When Count Ferrand arrived in Flanders he was met
by the action of a strong feudal party, secretly supported
by the subsidies of Philip August. He tried to escape
the threatening French influence and, following the policy
of his predecessors, appealed to England for help. Now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>began a fierce struggle between French and English gold
for influence in the country. Moderately financed by
England, the partisans of the latter became stronger every
day. Finally Count Ferrand took a decided stand,
repudiated his allegiance to his overlord, and openly
accepted the English alliance. Just at this time a vast
coalition had been organized against the French king by
John I of England, Emperor Otto of Brunswick, and
Henry I, Duke of Brabant, with whom Ferrand of Flanders
joined. On July 27, 1214, the battle of Bouvines was
fought. The allies were defeated by Philip August;
Count Ferrand of Flanders fell into the hands of his feudal
lord, and was imprisoned at Paris.</p>

<p>The victory of Bouvines established the political
hegemony of France in Europe and the subjection of
Flanders. The former policy of balance was no longer
possible for the Belgian princes. In face of the overwhelming
power of the French King, there remained
nothing but submission. From the date of the battle of
Bouvines to the beginning of the fourteenth century
Flanders was subject to the political and intellectual
domination of its strong neighbor.</p>

<p>The other Belgian principalities likewise shared the
ambition to win the friendship of the French King.
From now on the French monarchs found no occasion
for armed interference with the Belgian princes. Diplomacy
met all needs, and agents from Paris, often shrewd
Italians, brought to the heads of the Belgian principalities
the wishes—and orders—of their master.</p>

<p>Only one Belgian prince, the Duke of Brabant, resisted
the French influence. Since the former duchy of Lotharingia,
at the beginning of the twelfth century, had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
broken up into many parts, Brabant became the leading
power in the central part of Belgium. The house of the
dukes of Brabant was indeed the only dynasty that could
boast of its national origin; the other Belgian principalities
all fell, during the thirteenth century, into the
hands of new and foreign families. The dynasty of
Brabant was thus exceedingly popular; it won the affection
of the noblemen and of the communes, and the person
of the duke was the object of real national affection.
Moreover, the policy of the dukes was positive and
practical, and, above all, paid due regard to the interests
of their subjects. One of the main principles of this
policy was the conquest of the commercial highroad
between the Rhine and the sea, upon which the economic
prosperity of Brabant depended.</p>

<p>As the principality of Liège and the county of Limburg
blocked the road to the east, controlling all traffic between
the Rhine and Bruges, after the reign of Henry I (1190)
the dukes of Brabant turned their eyes in this direction.
The war with Liège in Henry’s time was not very <span class="err" title="original: succesful">successful</span>.
During the thirteenth century, therefore, the dukes
sought to overpower Liège by a resort to diplomacy. As
the bishop-prince of Liège was engaged in a continuous
struggle against the communes, the dukes of Brabant
sometimes supported the bishop against the burgesses,
sometimes helped the latter against their lord, according
to the needs of the moment.</p>

<p>Ever since 1283, when the Countess Ermengard of
Limburg died without heirs, the dukes had cast covetous
eyes on Limburg. Many pretenders, including several
princes from the left bank of the Rhine, had sprung up.
Duke John I of Brabant decided to strike the final blow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
against the coalition formed against him by the lords of
Fauquemont, the Count of Luxemburg, Renaud of
Gueldre, and the mighty Archbishop of Cologne. The
coming battle would decide to whom should belong the
supremacy between the Rhine and the Meuse. By skilful
diplomacy, Duke John succeeded in preventing the Count
of Flanders and the Bishop of Liège from allying themselves
with his enemies. On June 5, 1288, the armies
met at Worringen, on the Rhine. The battle lasted a
whole day with terrific onslaughts. The army of Brabant,
composed of the knights of the duchy, and the communal
infantry from Louvain, Brussels, Antwerp, Tirlemont,
Jodoigne, and Nivelles, although inferior in numbers
to the foe, won a complete victory by the superiority
of its tactics. It was a rout for Duke John’s enemies.
Twelve hundred of them fell on the battlefield, and both
the Archbishop of Cologne and the Count of Gueldre
were made prisoners, the Count of Luxemburg and his
brothers being numbered among the slain. By sunset,
the remainder of the enemy was in full flight and the
trumpets of Brabant gaily proclaimed the victory.</p>

<p>The victory of Worringen had far-reaching consequences.
It sealed the political decline of the archbishops
of Cologne, who thenceforth interfered no more in Belgian
affairs; Limburg was annexed by Brabant, and the latter
extended its authority over the east of Lotharingia.
The dukes now controlled the commercial road between
Germany and the sea, and commanded the course of the
Meuse, and since their sway encircled the principality of
Liège, no further danger was to be feared in this quarter.
The German Emperor made no protest against the annexation
of Limburg, although it was actually territory of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
Empire. It was now perfectly clear that the influence of
Germany in Eastern Belgium had come to an end.</p>

<p>This fact encouraged the kings of France to seek to
occupy in Belgian affairs the place formerly occupied by
Germany. But although the dukes of Brabant maintained
peaceful relations with France, they had no wish
to become simply the instruments of French politics.
They resisted every attempt at domination. Henceforth
Brabant, thanks to its spirit of independence, the strong
and able diplomacy of its rulers, and the growing spirit of
patriotism that characterized its people, became more and
more the bulwark of Belgian liberty. It will be found
hereafter as the very center of resistance to every attempt
at foreign domination, and, in the sixteenth century, it
was the States of Brabant which led the struggle against
the tyranny of Spain.</p>

<p>At the time that the battle of Worringen strengthened
the position of Brabant in Central and Eastern Belgium,
a new king, Philip IV, called Philip the Fair, ascended the
throne of France. His policy was to continue and complete
the plans of Philip August, the strengthening of the
central power at the expense of the grand vassals, and
the subjection of Flanders to the crown.</p>

<p>The ruling count in Flanders at this time was Guy de
Dampierre, whose family came originally from Champagne.
Guy had become one of the most powerful princes
of Belgium. Supported by the French King, he had
successfully brought to an end a struggle with the hostile
dynasty of the D’Avesnes in Hainaut, had annexed the
county of Namur, and had won real influence in Liège,
Luxemburg, and Gueldre. Philip the Fair soon began to
fear the growing might of his vassal and decided to crush it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span></p>

<p>The internal struggles in Flanders offered him an
opportune pretext. In the beginning, it was only the
wealthy, the merchants and owners of property, who
exercised political power in the commune and who controlled
the offices. Later on, the laboring classes, forming
themselves into corporations, became powerful and
claimed the right to control the administration of the
communal finances and a share in the public offices.
The wealthy—the patricians—resisted, endeavoring to
maintain their preponderance. The result was a violent
civil war between patricians and craftsmen, between rich
and poor. Everywhere leaders appeared in support of
the poor: at Liège, Henry of Dinant; at Louvain, Peter
Coutereel; in Flanders, Yoens, Ackerman, Artevelde.
Generally speaking, after the fourteenth century the
craftsmen triumphed, but everywhere only after bloody
revolts. Once victorious, the laboring classes in many
cities expelled the patricians from all public offices and
admitted them only when enlisted in some corporation of
craftsmen. In this manner the democratic régime was
established in place of the former aristocracy.</p>

<p>Nowhere were those democratic struggles so violent
as in Flanders. There the three powerful communes of
Ghent, Bruges, and Ypres tyrannized over the smaller
cities and the country. In order to crush the supremacy
of the patricians, who were the masters in these three
cities, Count Guy de Dampierre supported the claims of
the craftsmen. In their turn, the patricians appealed for
help to the King of France, feudal lord of their count.
Thus two parties sprang into existence: the party of the
poor, who, faithful to the Count, adopted his banner with
the device of the Lion of Flanders, and took the name of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
<i>Clauwaerts</i> (“men of the [lion’s] claw”); and the party
of the wealthy patricians, protected by King Philip, who,
owing to the presence of a fleur-de-lis in the royal French
banner, were called <i>Leliaerts</i> (“men of the lily”).</p>

<p>On the cry for help by the latter, King Philip invaded
Flanders, defeated the army of the Count, took his vassal
prisoner, and treated the country as a conquered land.</p>

<p>But the arrogance of the French and especially of the
governor, Jacques de Chatillon, excited the anger of the
craftsmen. Those of Bruges secretly recalled the <i>Clauwaerts</i>
who had been expelled from the city. Under the
leadership of a weaver, Peter de Coninck, a revolt was
planned. On a summer day of 1302, in the early hours
of the morning, the conspirators entered Bruges, surprised
the French and their sympathizers, and killed
them. This event is spoken of as <i>Matines brugeoises</i>,
“The Matins of Bruges.”</p>

<p>Exasperated, King Philip decided to avenge the revolt
and the offense against his authority. A mighty army
again invaded the country. Immediately the sons of the
Count, John of Namur and William of Gulick, together
with Peter de Coninck, organized resistance. The
struggle was no longer a merely economic one between
patricians and their French protectors on one side and the
poor, as partisans of the Count, on the other. It was now
a really national struggle, for defeat of the Flemish communes
would mean the annexation of Flanders by France.</p>

<p>Under the walls of Courtrai, in the meadows of Groeninghe,
the soldier-citizens of Bruges, assisted by many
contingents of craftsmen from other parts of the country,
met the flower of the French knighthood. The apparently
impossible happened. The communes, fighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
for the very existence of their country, defeated the army
of the most powerful king in Christendom.</p>

<p>That victory is called the “battle of the Golden Spurs,”
because nearly six hundred golden spurs, belonging to the
French knights, were found on the battlefield and suspended,
as a token of thanks to God, in the vault of the
basilica of Courtrai.</p>

<p>The consequences of the battle of the Golden Spurs
cannot be overestimated. From a political point of view
it presents the same importance as the battle of Bouvines.
It liberated Flanders from French influence and gave the
first blow to the hegemony of France in Europe. In
Rome, Pope Boniface VIII, a fierce enemy of King Philip,
arose in the middle of the night in order to receive and
rejoice over the news.</p>

<p>Because the victory saved the national independence
of Flanders and practically prevented the political absorption
of the other Belgian principalities by Philip the Fair,
the Flemings, on July 11 of each year, celebrate the
anniversary of the battle of the Golden Spurs as a great
event in Belgian history.</p>

<p>The victory of Courtrai gave impetus to real national
feeling: all classes, and not least the priests, contributed
with all their power to organizing further resistance to the
French armies. During the first twenty years of the
fourteenth century Flanders, by its own forces, without
foreign assistance, resisted the onslaughts of three successive
French kings. After the battle of Mons-en-Pevèle
(1303), which brought neither victory nor defeat
for either side, the Flemings arrived with a new army,
and Philip the Fair is quoted as having shouted in despair:
“It rains Flemings!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span></p>

<p>Finally peace was concluded in 1305 at Athis-sur-Orge.
As a result of the intrigues of the French agents
and the treachery of the Flemish delegates the conditions
were very unfavorable for Flanders. The new count,
Robert of Béthune, wanted peace; he did not care for
the interests of the cities and the victory of the democratic
party. The country was obliged to yield and, in
1319, after a new war, caused by the intrigues of the
French King, was forced to abandon Walloon Flanders,
including the cities of Lille, Douai, and Béthune. As the
county of Artois had already been ceded to France in the
time of Philip August, Flanders possessed no more Walloon
territory. It retained only the old Germanic portions.
It was a severe loss, but by that loss Flanders
escaped forever absorption by the French monarchy.</p>

<p>The battle of the Golden Spurs not only had far-reaching
results from a national point of view; it also
confirmed the victory of the democratic elements over
the patricians in Flanders. In those Flemish cities where
the latter were masters at the time of the battle they
were <span class="err" title="original: overthown">overthrown</span> by the craftsmen after the victory.
Moreover, the craftsmen of Liège, in the same year, and
under the influence of the defeat of the Flemish patricians
at Courtrai, which taught them that they could win if
they were organized, inaugurated a revolt against the
patricians of their own city. After many years of bloody
struggle, they succeeded in wresting from the bishop-prince,
Adolf de la Marck, the Peace of Fexhe, that
practically founded the liberties of Liège. In Brabant,
some years after the battle of Courtrai, in 1306, the
craftsmen tried also to imitate their Flemish brethren
but here they were severely defeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span></p>

<p>The movement, however, was now everywhere in full
swing. The rights of the princes were more and more
curtailed by the successful revolts of the craftsmen, and
assurances were required that the privileges of the communes
would be respected for all time. These demands
resulted in the appointment of committees, composed of
members of the nobility and members of the cities, the
latter preponderating in number, in order to guarantee
the privileges granted the commune at its inception and
those won during the democratic struggles. We find
such a committee in Brabant, where it was called the
Council of Cortemberg (1312), and in the principality of
Liège, under the name of Tribunal of the XXII.</p>

<p>One of the most famous privileges won by the people
during the communal struggles of the fourteenth century
is that called the Joyeuse Entrée of Brabant (1354-56).
According to the stipulations of that charter of liberty,
the territory of the duchy was to remain undivided and
undiminished; the seven important cities of Brabant
were to keep in their common possession the documents
containing the municipal liberties; no offensive war was
to be waged, no treaty concluded, no inch of territory
ceded, no coin made, without the consent of the subjects.
Commerce was to be free, and only legal taxes were to be
imposed. The Duke undertook to care for the safety of
the roads, to protect his people from arrest in foreign
countries, to keep peace between the Rhine and the
Meuse, and to respect the treaties concluded with
Flanders and Liège. No native of Brabant might
prosecute a fellow-countryman before a foreign court.
The Duke himself was to be subject to the laws of the
duchy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span></p>

<p>A comparison of the political situation, as revealed by
privileges like these, with the tyranny of the princes in
feudal times, brings into a strong light all that was
achieved, in point of view of freedom and liberty, by the
communes of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.</p>

<p>The development of civic freedom and the spirit of
democracy, such as we have described, in Flanders, Brabant,
and Liège, did not exist, however, in the same
measure in all the principalities of Belgium. They were
the pride only of those regions where industrial and economic
conditions had created the necessary basis for such
developments. In the more agricultural regions of the
country they were less in evidence or were introduced
much later, and they did not make so deep an impression
on the life of the people.</p>

<p>Luxemburg, for example, was a very large province,
but not thickly populated. It was far removed from the
large rivers, while the hills and forests made communication
very difficult. In the rocky lines the manors of the
robber barons were built, and those watched the passing
convoys of merchantmen and attacked them frequently.
The historian Froissart depicts very realistically the
aspect of the country. Speaking of the passing of the
French troops through Luxemburg in 1388, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Two thousand workmen were sent ahead through the forests
of Chimay and Neufchateau, in order to clear the way for the
troops and to construct a road for the passage of the 1,200 carts
of the army. When it had passed the picturesque convent of
Orval, the army encountered severe difficulties: it advanced only
two miles a day toward Bastogne, through the passes of the
Ardennes, infested by savage animals and inhabited only by
some colliers. The passage became even more difficult in October,
when the rivers overflowed from the rain, when the rocks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
were slippery and the roads impassable. The barons of the
Ardennes took advantage of it for attacking the convoys and
pillaging the train.</p>
</div>

<p>In such a country there could be no question of democratic
movements, of freedom and the privileges of cities.
During the fourteenth century Luxemburg was famous,
not for its communes, but for its princes. A most sympathetic
figure among them is Duke John, who married
Elizabeth of Bohemia and became king of that country.
He was the perfect type of mediaeval chivalry. He went
through Italy, Poland, France, and Germany as a knight
errant, fighting for all good causes. Although he became
blind he assisted at the battle of Crécy (1346) and was
killed in the ranks of the French army.</p>

<p>The county of Namur was far more receptive of the
ideas of liberty and democracy than was Luxemburg.
The Meuse and the Sambre flowed through its hills
and fields; it possessed commercial roads and copper
and iron mines. Here then we find commerce and
industry. The craftsmen of Namur won, little by little
and but very slowly, a certain share in the government
of the cities, and after some serious troubles in 1351
the deans of the craft-guilds were admitted to public
office together with the appointees of the Count and
the patricians. In the circumstances which attended
this struggle and in the acquisition of office by the guilds
we have indications of the lines of cleavage between the
classes and of current political tendencies.</p>

<p>There remains the county of Hainaut to be considered.
From 1299 Hainaut and Holland, although situated far
apart, were united under one dynasty, the family of
the D’Avesnes. Holland was mainly inhabited by burgesses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
and farmers; Hainaut was the last refuge of feudalism. 
The hills of the Ardennes, extending into the
country, permitted small opportunity for agriculture:
the rocks were crowned by castles, and the forests offered
splendid hunting. There was no trade; the existing
mines were abandoned. Of course there was the cloth
industry at Mons, Ath, Binche, and Chièvres. But the
weavers did not possess the same spirit of freedom as their
Flemish comrades. A timid attempt at revolt at Valenciennes
was quickly repressed. Feudalism continued to
prevail. The knights of Hainaut spent their time in
fighting, especially during the reign of Count William
(1337-45), who organized expeditions against the Prussians
and the Moors. At length the noblemen of Hainaut
were nearly all exterminated on the various battlefields
of Europe, and the cities began to add to their importance.
Count Albert of Bavaria, in the middle of the fourteenth
century, favored manufactures, and granted control
over the affairs of the cities to the craftsmen.</p>

<p>On the whole, it was Flanders which played the largest
part in the history of Belgium in the fourteenth century.
The burgesses of Flanders had saved the country from
French domination. But with the foe once defeated,
they began to fight each other, and the main events in
Flemish history at this time are bloody internal struggles
and continuous revolts against the national princes.
Ghent and Bruges, the two most powerful cities of the
county, were continuously in disagreement, and eventually
took up arms against each other. Since the battle
of the Golden Spurs Bruges had retained its democratic
spirit and Ghent remained, as in the time of Philip the
Fair, the bulwark and the refuge of the patricians. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
craftsmen of Ghent did not succeed in overthrowing
their enemies because they were themselves divided.
The tyranny of the weavers was often opposed by the
other guilds.</p>

<p>It was a question of foreign policy, however, which
finally subjected Flanders to a severe trial. In France
the dynasty of the Capetians was extinct, and a new
family, the Valois, ascended the throne. Edward III,
King of England, claimed to have rights to the French
crown and decided to inaugurate a war in order to enforce
his demands. He sought allies on the Continent and
succeeded in obtaining the support of Emperor Louis of
Bavaria (1337), to whom he paid a large sum of English
gold.</p>

<p>What was to be the attitude of Flanders in the forthcoming
conflict? Count Louis of Flanders was a French
sympathizer and took the side of King Philip of Valois.
The Flemish cities, however, did not desire a rupture
with England; their economic interest depended entirely
on friendly relations with that country, owing to the fact
that they needed English wool for their cloth industry.</p>

<p>At this juncture appeared Jacques Van Artevelde,
a man great in Belgian history. He was a member of
one of the patrician families, wealthy, and much respected.
In 1338 he became captain of the municipal army of
Flanders and soon found himself even more powerful than
the Count. When the English delegates, sent by Edward
III to win Flanders to his cause, arrived in the country,
they visited Artevelde as the real leader of public opinion.</p>

<p>Although sympathetic to the English cause, Artevelde,
partly fearing the resentment of the French King and
partly wishing to prevent his country from becoming the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
battlefield of the hostile armies, first tried the policy of
neutrality. He confined himself to assuring England of
his friendship, thinking that this would suffice to win for
Flanders the commercial advantages it needed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the conception of neutrality was premature
at this moment of Belgian history. The increasing
pressure of Edward III on the one hand and the persistent
distrust of France on the other convinced Artevelde
that he had to choose between the belligerents.
That was a delicate and dangerous task, for the Flemings
faced a conflict between their commercial interest and
their duty toward their feudal lord, the King of France.
Artevelde, “the wise man of Ghent,” acted cleverly.
On his suggestion, Edward III declared himself to be the
true king of France, for he was the grandson of Philip the
Fair through his mother, whereas Philip of Valois was
only the nephew of the former ruler. The Flemings,
easily convinced by these claims, put their scruples aside,
and accepted the idea of the Anglo-Flemish alliance.
The French fleet was destroyed by the English at L’Ecluse
(1340), but Tournai was vainly besieged by the Anglo-Flemish
forces. Artevelde became more and more the
confidant of the English King, who called him “his
fellow” and highly appreciated his shrewd diplomacy.</p>

<p>The power of the “wise man of Ghent” soon aroused
the jealousy of many, and was greatly endangered when
the English King, annoyed by the reluctance of the
Flemings to conclude with him a complete treaty of
alliance, suddenly abandoned his claims and left his allies
in the lurch. A sudden outburst of hostility put an end
to Artevelde’s career. His enemies informed the people
that he had favored England too much, that he had given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
the treasure of Flanders to the English King, and that he
intended to offer the crown to the Prince of Wales. Only
the last charge was true. But the people, stirred up by
demagogues who had planned the fall of the “wise man,”
believed what they were told. A furious mob attacked
the house of Artevelde. While he was trying to persuade
them that he was falsely accused, he was overpowered
and ignominiously slain (1345). “The poor exalted him,
the wicked killed him,” that is the epitaph written by
Froissart, his political adversary, in honor of the greatest
Fleming of all times.</p>

<p>The assassination of Artevelde was followed a short
time after by the death of his enemy, the Count of Flanders
himself. Louis of Nevers fell among the French knights
on the battlefield of Crécy, where the English King won
a decisive victory. The new count, Louis of Male, was
an enemy of democracy. He had to meet a serious revolt
of the craftsmen of Ghent, under the leadership of Philip,
the son of Artevelde. The son of the “wise man” had
no particular military or political talents; his extraction
alone had commended him to the restless people of Ghent.
He tried to renew the alliance with England, but failed.
A French army was sent to Flanders in order to assist
the Count against his subjects. In the battle of Roosebeke,
near Courtrai (1382), the Flemings were defeated
and Philip Van Artevelde was killed. The whole of
Flanders fell into the hands of the victors, except the
commune of Ghent. That mighty city, thanks to the
courage of Peter Vanden Bossche and his troops, resisted
the kingdom of France for two years.</p>

<p>Finally, Louis of Male, the last of the family of the
Dampierre, died in 1384. His death opens the rule of
the Burgundian dukes in the history of Flanders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span></p>

<p>The many years of internal struggle had seriously
injured the prosperity of Flemish trade and industry.
The finances of the communes were ruined; poverty was
on the increase; the income from licenses had diminished;
foreign merchants complained of the insecurity of their
goods. Edward III invited many Flemish to emigrate
to England, which they did, and the Flemish counts, by
punishing the rebellious cities, had themselves cut off
many sources of production and wealth. From 1350
on, the German Hansa, whose members resided at Bruges,
complained of the heavy taxes, and of the complete
lack of peace and safety. In 1380 the Count banished
the merchants, charging them with having plotted against
his authority and with having assisted the Flemish rebels.
This was a serious blow to the prosperity of the country.
The Hansa left Bruges for Antwerp. Here began the
decline and fall of the once famous seaport.</p>

<p>If we look back at this stage of the political development
of the Belgian principalities during the time of the
communes we note a growing tendency to consolidation
on the part of most of the duchies and counties. At the
end of the fourteenth century, Flanders, Brabant, and
Limburg were united under one dynasty; the same thing
occurred in the case of Hainaut and Holland. Little by
little the separation resulting from the treaty of Verdun
in the ninth century had disappeared, and all parts of
Belgium had gradually experienced the imperceptible
drawing together which time had effected. They were
ultimately to be united, as a political body, by the dukes
of Burgundy. To explain that result is the task of the
next chapter.</p>

<p class="center">THE UNION OF THE BELGIAN PRINCIPALITIES
UNDER THE DUKES OF BURGUNDY</p>

<p>At the very moment when all the Belgian principalities
had won their complete political autonomy and rejected
the French, the English, and the German influence, they
were brought together under the scepter of one dynasty,
and became united in a solid monarchic federation. As
such, they constitute, between Germany and France, that
buffer state represented on the map of Europe by the
kingdoms of Belgium and Holland. The unconscious
tendency of the preceding centuries was brought to a
head in the fifteenth century by the dukes of Burgundy.
They were aided in large part by the political circumstances
of the time. France was exhausted after the
Hundred Years’ War and Germany had lost the prestige
and the strength of its monarchic power. In favoring the
desire for a union of the Belgian principalities, the dukes
saved Belgium from conquest or absorption by France.
They continued and completed the work of the warriors
of the battle of the Golden Spurs. The Scheldt was no
longer a political barrier between the east and the west
of the country. Belgium, as a united political body, was
now for the first time a reality.</p>

<p>The achievements of the Burgundian dukes may be
considered from two points of view. We may consider
the territorial and geographical consolidation and the
political reform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span></p>

<p>As for the territorial consolidation, there existed, at
the end of the fourteenth century, three ruling houses in
Belgium, each of them dominating many provinces, and
each hoping to bring the whole country under its scepter.
These houses were those of Luxemburg, Bavaria, and
Burgundy. The house of Luxemburg had annexed to its
hereditary duchy the duchies of Brabant and Limburg;
that of Bavaria ruled Hainaut, Holland, and Zeeland;
that of Burgundy possessed the duchy of the same name
with the counties of Flanders and Artois. It was the
Duchess Jeanne of Brabant who turned the scale in
favor of Burgundy. Although she had promised the
duchy of Brabant to the house of Luxemburg, she gave it
to her niece, wife of Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy
and Count of Flanders. So, in 1404, according to the
testamentary devises of the late Jeanne of Brabant,
Brabant and Limburg went to Antoine, youngest son of
Philip the Bold, while to John without Fear, the eldest
son, were given Flanders and Artois. There were thus
a Flemish and a Brabantine branch of Burgundy. Antoine,
Duke of Brabant, married Elizabeth of Gorlitz,
heiress of the duchy of Luxemburg, and annexed that
vast territory to his two other duchies (1409). His son
John IV, by his marriage with Jacqueline of Bavaria,
added to the duchies transmitted by his father the counties
of Hainaut, Holland, Zeeland, and the seigneurie of
Friesland. John IV was an insignificant prince. History
remembers him for having, in 1425, founded the University
of Louvain. His brother, Philip de Saint-Pol, died without
issue, and thereupon the states of Brabant offered
the possessions of the Brabantine branch of Burgundy
to the head of the Flemish branch, Philip the Good, Count<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
of Flanders (1430). As Philip the Good had purchased
in 1429 the county of Namur, practically all the Belgian
principalities came under the same rule. At this moment
the unity of Belgium was born. Only the three ecclesiastical
principalities of Cambrai, Liège, and Utrecht failed to
become united with the other provinces, and in these
the Burgundian dukes exerted their influence by appointing
members of their family as bishops or by supporting
candidates in the episcopal elections who were devoted
to their interests.</p>

<p>Philip the Good, whom the historian Juste Lipse
called, in the seventeenth century, <i>conditor Belgii</i> (“the
founder of Belgium”), was known in his own times as the
Grand Duke of the West. The fame of his power was
carried to the Mediterranean, where his vessels fought the
Turkish pirates. He lacked only the title of king. He
instituted negotiations with the Emperor for restoring in
his favor the former kingdom of Lotharingia. These negotiations
did not succeed because he refused to pay to
Frederick III, the German Emperor, the sum the latter
demanded, and to give the oath of allegiance and vassalage
for those parts of his possessions which were fiefs
of the Empire. He boasted to an envoy of Louis XI,
King of France, that “he wanted them to know he could
have been king, if he had only willed it.”</p>

<p>His work was nearly destroyed by the extravagant
plans and the ambition of his son, Charles the Bold, who
succeeded him in 1467. The reign of Charles was dominated
by the struggle with the shrewd King of France,
Louis XI. This king watched with anxiety the increasing
power of one of his vassals, and tried to circumvent
his plans in all possible ways. The schemes of Charles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
the Bold were fantastically extensive, and the historian
Philip de Comines said of him: “He tried so many things
that he could not live long enough to carry them out,
and they were indeed almost impossible enterprises.”</p>

<p>As the house of Burgundy tried to dominate the
principality of Liège, Charles followed that policy by
imposing upon the citizens of Liège the candidacy of
Louis of Bourbon as bishop-prince. The people of the
principality, stirred up by the French King, rose against
the mighty duke. They paid a heavy price. In 1466
the town of Dinant was sacked by the troups of Charles
the Bold, and in 1468 Liège shared the same fate. Unspeakable
atrocities were committed by the Burgundian
army, and fire and sword nearly decimated the populace.
These disasters placed the principality for at least ten
years under the domination of Charles.</p>

<p>The states of the Burgundian dukes were composed
of two sections, separated from each other by independent
principalities. In the south, they possessed the
duchy of Burgundy and the county of the same name,
also called Franche-Comté; in the north, Belgium and a
large part of the Dutch provinces were in their hands.
From 1469 on, Charles tried patiently but relentlessly
to bring together both parts of his state. He took
Lorraine by force and got in <i>engagère</i> Alsace, Brisgau, and
other minor principalities. In the north he succeeded,
in 1472, in winning, by the testament of the late Arnold
of Gueldre, the duchy of that name and the county of
Zutphen.</p>

<p>Adopting the plan which his father had devised, but
enlarging it considerably, he began negotiations with the
Emperor for the reconstitution of the former mediaeval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
kingdom of Burgundy, and for his appointment as King of
the Romans and successor to the Empire. He failed
where Philip the Good had failed.</p>

<p>He intended next to conquer the country of his enemy,
Louis XI. After the conquest he planned to divide
France between himself and his brother-in-law, Edward
of England. In order to avoid the danger, the French
King cleverly entangled his vassal in a war with the Swiss.
Charles fought the battle of Nancy under very unfavorable
circumstances. His army was severely defeated and
he himself killed. His body was discovered in the ice of
a frozen pool, pierced by three deadly wounds and half
devoured by wolves.</p>

<p>His young daughter Mary took on her shoulders the
heavy burden entailed upon her as his successor.</p>

<p>The territorial federation of all the Belgian principalities
by the Burgundian dukes involved as a consequence
the political unification of these provinces.
Having but one prince, they also had but one government.
It was necessary, of course, that the individual
institutions of each principality should disappear, and
the political life of the country was subjected to the
centralizing tendency of a common monarchy. Above
the local institutions were established central institutions,
common to all the territories: the council of the duke,
an advisory body; the chancellor of Burgundy, a kind
of prime minister; the Grand Council, a governmental
body, which Charles the Bold, more autocratic than his
father, divided into two new colleges, with distinct
functions—the Council of State, a political college, and
the Parliament of Malines, a supreme court of justice
(1473).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span></p>

<p>Such a centralization of the national institutions was
quite necessary if the danger of being dominated by
France was to be avoided. France was rapidly becoming
united under the leadership of its kings, who possessed a
permanent army, the right to impose a perpetual <i>taille</i>,
and the exercise of sovereign justice. In the face of this
united and powerful monarchy, the Burgundian state
could not remain separated. The Belgian provinces could
no longer remain isolated from each other and limit
themselves to an individualistic and egotistic policy.
It was seen that everything ought to be concentrated in
the hands of a strong prince. That was the new idea
that was introduced into the constitution of the Belgian
principalities, an idea that had never appeared prior to
the fifteenth century. Throughout the Middle Ages the
antiquated idea of the state as a collective person distinct
from its members never clearly appears. The concept
of sovereignty—absolute power subject to no control—was
also lacking. The individual life dominated the life
of the community. Little by little the renascence of the
study of Roman law introduced other concepts, namely,
those of state and sovereignty. The students of Roman
law, the “legists,” stood for a government that would be
one, indivisible, strong, absolute, and active. They believed
that all that tended to limit the complete exercise
of public authority should be discarded: the state was
held to be impersonal and almighty. That new concept of
the state was embodied in the politics of the Burgundian
dukes during the fifteenth century. Centralization and
the absolute power of the prince took the place of the
former personal and collective privileges. This idea
triumphed, not only because the Burgundian dukes were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
strong, but also because it was in accordance with the
needs of the time and the wishes of the majority of the
people.</p>

<p>Of course, the dukes, when they tried to realize their
political centralization, met with some resistance on the
part of the powerful communes. But Philip the Good
cleverly avoided any open fight. He simply tried to
subject the cities to his control—to prevent them from
being a state within the state. He took part in the
appointment of the magistrates, ordered their accounts
to be examined by his officers, forbade advantage to be
taken of the small cities and the peasantry, and made
the judgments of their tribunals subject to review by his
own councils of justice. Flanders endeavored to evade
the results of that policy. There were serious revolts
in Bruges (1436-47) and in Ghent (1450-53), and the
cities of Brabant, particularly Malines, seemed unwilling
to adapt themselves to the new situation.</p>

<p>All this local resistance was ruthlessly broken by
Charles the Bold when he became duke. The autonomy
of the cities was completely disregarded, the traditions
were changed without consideration, the privileges remained
unrecognized. Charles kept the appointment of
all the municipal charges in his own hands. The omnipotence
of the sovereign was, according to him, the only
warrant for order and justice, such as he himself desired
for his possessions.</p>

<p>Political centralization would, however, never have
been achieved by the dukes if they had not enjoyed the
support of certain classes of the people. They had,
indeed, the help of the noblemen, who were despised
and ignored by the communes, and were therefore ready<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
to help all the enemies of the cities. Moreover, the
dukes succeeded in destroying the feudal character of the
nobility, in softening it, and in converting it into a body
of courtiers. They attracted the noblemen by making
them royal allowances, by granting them gifts of land or
money, offices at court, etc. A golden chain soon bound
all the feudalists, once so independent; and life at court
soon robbed them of their former spirit of freedom.
Before long, the favor of the prince constituted the only
chance of success in political and social life. In order to
keep the nobles loyal to his person, Philip the Good
founded at Bruges, in 1480, the famous and privileged
order of the Golden Fleece.</p>

<p>Only the Burgundian and Picardian nobles, however,
were to be found at court, occupying the public offices,
and entirely submissive to their sovereign. The Belgian
nobles could not forget that the rights of the prince,
according to national tradition, were not without limits;
they desired a guaranty against the dangers of personal
government. They desired a government in which the
duke would not be able to declare war without the consent
of the states, in which he would regulate his expenses in
accordance with the income of his domain, and in which
he would act only after having taken the advice of his
council.</p>

<p>The dukes were also supported in their efforts toward
centralization by the clergy. Philip the Good had
abolished exemption from taxation till that time enjoyed
by the clergy, asserting that the common law was opposed
to such privileges. Following the example of the King
of France, the Duke limited the temporal power of the
clergy, narrowed their jurisdiction, and imposed upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
church his candidates for bishoprics and monasteries.
On the other hand, the Duke extended the political power
of the clergy, giving them the first place in the States-General
and in the councils. The States-General was a
new institution, also introduced by the Burgundian dukes.
Before the existence of the States-General, the prince
was compelled, whenever a levy of taxes was desired, to
deliberate separately with the delegates of each Belgian
province and to obtain their consent. Philip the Good
thought it more expedient to gather them all together in
his presence at the same time. That meeting was called
the meeting of the States-General. As the States-General
did not meet except at the express order of the sovereign,
and for his own advantage, this institution served as an
instrument for weakening provincial individualism and
strengthening the central government.</p>

<p>In the States-General the clergy were granted the first
place; they, as well as the nobles, therefore became supporters
of the policy of the dukes. By such methods,
by persuasion, by distribution of money, and even by violence,
the Burgundian dukes succeeded in transforming the
institutions of the Belgian principalities into a monarchical
rule.</p>

<p>Most of the new institutions were modeled after those
existing in France, but adapted to the local situation and
needs of Belgium. No principality lost its own autonomy,
its own constitution, or its privileges. The Burgundian
state was an agglomeration of states, a juxtaposition of
territories. There was no universal power; the dukes
were not “princes of Belgium” or “princes of the Netherlands”;
they ruled every principality separately and
were dukes of Brabant, counts of Flanders, dukes of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>Luxemburg, counts of Hainaut, Namur, etc. But their
power was as vast as their wealth. When Philip the Good
died in 1467, he left a personal fortune whose annual
income nearly equaled that of the republic of Venice and
was as much as four times that of the republic of Florence,
three times that of the King of Naples, twice that of the
Pope and of the Duke of Milan. No wonder that he
was called “the Grand Duke of the West.”</p>

</figure>

<p>What about the Belgian civilization in the time of the
Burgundian dukes?</p>

<p>We know that, toward the end of the fourteenth
century, Flanders suffered a decline after the bloody
civil war: the German merchants left Bruges, Ghent lost
a part of its population, Ypres was half destroyed,
Ostend became a sandy waste. The “polders” were
inundated; wolves and wild boars infested the country.</p>

<p>Fifty years later, during the reign of the Burgundian
dukes, Belgium had again become the richest country
in Europe. That revival was, of course, not attributable
to the dukes alone. It must be remembered that the
Belgians are an industrious people and that the geographical
position of the country is highly favorable. But
the political union of all the provinces, peace, and a good
administration contributed largely to the revival of the
nation. The political work of the Burgundian dukes
brought about the unification of coinage, the free relations
between the different principalities, the order and safety
necessary for the development of trade and industry.
From an economic point of view, the dukes endeavored
to conserve and to enlarge the resources of the country.
They took prohibitive measures against the English cloth
industry in favor of the Flemish manufacture. Charles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
the Bold endeavored to dredge the sand out of the harbor
of Bruges and to save that city from disaster. In the
fifteenth century Antwerp, supported by the dukes,
became the largest market of the north. In Luxemburg
the gold and silver mines began to be operated, employing
the mine-workers of the region of Liège.</p>

<p>Although the economic policy of the dukes may be
described as still somewhat incoherent, it may yet be
said to have embraced excellent principles. A declaration
is preserved to the effect that “one of the main
points of all good policy, upon which the public welfare is
based, is to get and to keep good and lasting money, as
well golden as silver coin.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these principles and the various
measures taken for the protection of trade, a crisis in the
cloth industry was soon apparent. This was due to the
transformation in the wool trade. Bruges was the big
wool market of the Continent, but, since the development
of the English cloth industry, the English producers had
kept the raw material at home, thereby diminishing the
stock of wool in Flanders. The price had greatly increased,
and Flemish manufacturers were obliged to
use Spanish wool of inferior quality. This, of course,
spelled the decline of the Belgian cloth industry. The
decline of Louvain’s prosperity was somewhat mitigated
by the foundation there of the University in 1425.
Nothing, however, could save Ypres. Its craftsmen,
threatened with starvation, migrated to England; houses
were abandoned and fell into ruin; in 1456 a third of the
population was begging for bread along the roads.</p>

<p>Other parts of the country were less affected by the
crisis in the cloth industry. Ghent had its grain staple;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
Brussels, where the dukes resided, imported articles of
luxury; Malines had its Parliament; Antwerp took
the place of Bruges as a seaport. Since 1442, English
merchants had settled in Antwerp, and this meant the
end of Bruges and of the part played by Flanders in the
economic life of Belgium. It was now the turn of Brabant.
At the same time, a new industry was being introduced
into Flanders and Brabant, the technical features of
which were much the same as those of the cloth industry.
Wool was replaced by flax, and instead of cloth manufacture
we hear next of the linen industry. As manufacture
on a large scale, mediaeval in its forms and
restrictive and exclusive in its spirit of corporation, could
no longer support itself, the new linen industry soon came
to be carried on in the homes of the operatives, mainly in
the country. Driven out of Flanders by circumstances,
the cloth industry now sought to prolong its life in a little
town of the Ardennes—Verviers, near Liège (1480).</p>

<p>The conditions of trade likewise experienced decline
and revival at the same time. In this particular the
outstanding feature is the decline of Bruges. As is well
known, credit operations on a large scale sometimes
bring about big bankruptcies. Until the death of Charles
the Bold (1477), Bruges remained the financial and
banking center of Europe. It was filled with Italian
bankers, among them agents of the Medici, the Portinari,
and the Guidetti. A large number of foreign merchants
resided at Bruges, grouped in colonies known as “nations.”
Among them were the “nations” of Florence, of Spain,
and of the Osterlings. In 1457 the shipping in the harbor
was represented by three vessels from Venice, one from
Portugal, two from Spain, six from Scotland, forty-two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
from Bretagne, twelve from Hamburg, four whale-boats,
and thirty-six to forty fishing smacks. The vessels
came mainly from Spain and Portugal. They brought
merchandise hitherto unknown to the people of Belgium:
oranges, lemons, rose-water, candy, jam, oriental tapestry,
etc. From the Portuguese warehouses in Africa came
monkeys, lions, parrots.</p>

<p>In the course of the fifteenth century, however, for
reasons already indicated, the merchants of the German
Hansa left Bruges. As a result of the fall of the Flemish
cloth industry and the prohibitive measures taken against
England in favor of Flanders, the shipping company of
the English Merchant Adventurers sent large numbers to
settle at Antwerp in 1442-44. They were joined by the
Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese merchants. The bankers
soon followed. At the end of the fifteenth century the
glorious old Flemish city showed 4,000 to 5,000 empty
houses. From then on it became known as “Bruges la
morte.” Its rival, Antwerp, had become the center of the
cloth-weaving industry.</p>

<p>The inundations in Zeeland at the beginning of the
fifteenth century had considerably enlarged the western
Scheldt and afforded a direct route to the sea. Taking
advantage of this circumstance, Antwerp, from the very
beginning, showed a highly modern and liberal spirit.
It reduced the taxes on foreign merchants, whereas
Bruges, in order to save the situation, maintained its
restrictive and drastic legislation and tried to uphold its
economic privileges and its highly protectionist measures.
Moreover, Antwerp did not share the revolutionary spirit
of the Flemish communes. There were no bloody
struggles against the dukes, and there was the best of
understanding with the central power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span></p>

<p>The new spirit of Antwerp is shown in its commercial
organization. There were two fairs yearly, held on
the principle of commercial liberty. Those visiting the
fairs were protected by a special passport. Whereas a
monopoly existed in the professions of broker and money-changer
in Bruges, at Antwerp they were open to all.
The right of citizenship was easily acquired. In 1460,
Antwerp established the first exchange that existed in
Europe. At the end of the fifteenth century the city had
become the great commercial center of the north. But, as
earlier in the case of Bruges, the more important commerce
was in the hands of foreigners. The people of
Antwerp were but auxiliaries and intermediaries, brokers,
forwarding agents, charterers of vessels, etc. The same
phenomenon is observable in the Antwerp of today.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the political and economic transformations
which resulted in such crises in city life proved
advantageous for the peasantry, for the people of the
countryside. The decline of the tyranny of the big cities
tended to bring to the peasant more and more of freedom.
He was now free to engage in industry at home and to
become a paid workman in the service of the capitalist.
The old restrictions of the feudal law and the law of the
manor were gone.</p>

<p>Even in the realm of charity the changing order was
manifest. It was now taken in hand by the state.
Special ordinances against beggars were issued in 1461
for Flanders and Brabant. Heretofore, the beggar had
been abandoned to the tender mercies of the church and of
private charity. Thenceforth he was taken in hand by
the government. The state refused to encourage beggars;
it controlled them and forced them to work. A special
license for begging was granted to children under twelve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
years and to persons over sixty years, and to mothers with
numerous children and without work. Those found begging
without a license were imprisoned. The institutions
for charity, heretofore exclusively religious, were taken
over by the local governments. Boards of trustees were
appointed by the municipalities and the finances were
controlled by the <i>échevins</i>.</p>

<p>As for literary and artistic conditions in the Burgundian
period, it is to be noted that French influence
gradually disappeared after the battle of the Golden
Spurs. French of course remained the language of the
court, of the nobility, of the wealthy citizens. French,
together with Latin, also remained as the language of
diplomacy. But it made no more gains. At this time
Flemish began to take its place in civic life. As a result
of the victory of democracy in most of the cities, Flemish
became the language of the administration and was used
for the registration of real estate and for accounts.
Through existing relations with the merchants of the
Hansa it became also the language of commercial affairs.
Primary schools were established in all the cities, and
instruction was given in the language of the people. The
literary works of Van Maerlandt, whose influence has
already been described, came freely into the possession
of, and were read by, the humblest craftsmen.</p>

<p>When Charles the Bold tried to impose French as the
only official language, vigorous discontent was the result,
and in 1477 the so-called “Grand Privilege” of Mary of
Burgundy resulted in the re-establishment of Flemish.
The knowledge of Flemish also spread through the Walloon
country. Walloon merchants settled in Antwerp and
Flemish merchants went to Namur and Dinant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span></p>

<p>Under these favorable conditions, Flemish literature
developed rapidly; but the development mainly affected
Brabant. Brabant now took the place formerly occupied
by Flanders. The Brabantine dialect, instead of the
Flemish one, soon became dominant in literature. One of
the best writers of this time was Jan Boendale (†1365),
the famous author of the <i>Brabantsche Yeesten</i> (“Deeds of
Brabant”). Boendale was serious and practical, and
had no sympathy for France, like Van Maerlandt. He
was an enemy both of the democracy and of the nobility;
the merchants and the peasants were the classes with
which he showed the most sympathy. Another Flemish
author of great fame was Jan Van Ruysbroeck (†1381),
also a native of Brabant. He was the herald of mysticism
and of divine love, and occupies the first rank among all
the religious writers of the Middle Ages. He wrote in a
wonderful prose and surpassed everyone in inspiration of
thought. The Flemish literature owes also much to
another mystic, Gerard de Groote (†1384), of Deventer,
founder of the “Brethren of Common Life.” The members
of that community issued a large number of religious
tracts, all of them written in Flemish. They founded
excellent schools, where instruction was given by teachers
from the University of Paris, and they were the first to
introduce the art of printing into the Netherlands. The
most famous printer of the Netherlands, Thierry Martens,
of Alost, was one of their pupils. Wherever they
founded communities and schools they introduced the
art of printing, e.g., in Alost, Bruges, Brussels, Deventer,
Gouda, Louvain, and Utrecht.</p>

<p>As for French literature in Belgium during the Burgundian
period, its output was mainly devoted to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
aristocracy, and consisted chiefly of historical material.
The names of the historians Jean le Bel, Jean Froissart,
Monstrelet, and Chastelain are well known. Froissart was
a cosmopolitan writer, and most of the historians of this
school showed only a dynastic learning. There was no question
of patriotism. They praised the Burgundian dukes
because these dukes were their protectors and benefactors.</p>

<p>Artistic life, on the other hand, was not divided into
two separate currents, as was the literary life. In matters
of art, Flemish and Walloon collaborated during the
fifteenth century and together produced a real Belgian
art. The masters of this period were the Flemings Jan
and Hubert Van Eyck and the Walloon Roger de la
Pasture or Van der Weyden.</p>

<p>Since the end of the thirteenth century Belgian art had
become completely original. It was the wealth of city
life that rendered that phenomenon possible. The wealth
of the burgesses served to found many art industries.
Sculpture, painting, and the goldsmith’s art were no
longer exclusively religious; they became more and more
secular. The erection of large churches ceased. Painters
were busy decorating guild halls and city halls, banners
and tents, and painting for craft guilds and for dramatic
societies. The oldest products of Belgian art are to be
found in sculpture, especially monuments in stone or
yellow copper. The cleverness of technique and the
realism of outline compel admiration. The artists
copied with exactness what they noted in their surroundings.
For the stiff meagerness of the Gothic
style they substituted a more rounded form, and produced
a truer art as a result. One of the most
famous sculptors of this period was Claus Sluter, native<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
of Zeeland, creator of the celebrated sculptures of Dijon.
Those masterpieces, made when Ghiberti and Donatello
flourished in Italy, enable the Netherlands to share with
that country the first place in art of this period.</p>

<p>The painters forsook more slowly than did the sculptors
the traditions of the preceding period, but during the
period of the Burgundian dukes they made rapid strides.
The painters are to be found among the Flemings and the
Walloons; they were not influenced by the foreign schools,
and they dwelt in the cities of Flanders and Brabant,
where the presence of wealthy merchants and the residence
of the court afforded them the opportunities for the
exercise of their art. Hubert Van Eyck, of Limburg,
came to Ghent about 1430; his brother Jan settled in
Bruges in 1425; Roger Van der Weyden left Tournai
and located in Brussels in 1435. Other famous names
are those of Peter Christus, of Brabant; Simon Marmion,
of Valenciennes; Juste Van Wassenhove, of Ghent;
Hugo Van der Goes, of Ghent; Thierry Bouts, of Haerlem;
and the anonymous “Master of Flémalle.” This
is a period in which art and craftsmanship meant quite
different things; the personality of the painter was now
in free course of development.</p>

<p>Music also now began to be recognized as the expression
of the genius of both Belgian races, although musicians
were chiefly found among the Walloons, whereas the
painters were mainly Flemings. The names of the
musicians Jan Ockeghem (1494-96), a Fleming, and
Josquin des Prés (1450), a Walloon, may be mentioned as
having substituted the choir with many voices for the
choir with one voice, and as having introduced counterpoint
in musical composition. Architecture now came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
be regarded as of less importance than sculpture. Its
tendency was to a profusion of ornaments; the simplicity
of lines and the severe majesty of the Gothic style of the
thirteenth century disappeared. The prominence of
sculptural decoration was especially noticeable in the city
halls of Brussels and Louvain (1444-48), the latter
the masterpiece of Mathieu de Layens and one of the
richest examples of sculpture in the fifteenth century.
Louvain was fortunate also in possessing its no less
famous university (1425). That seat of learning was
founded at the request of Duke John IV of Brabant by
Pope Martin V. The faculty of theology was added to
the three other faculties (arts, law, and medicine) by
Pope Eugen IV in 1432. During the first quarter of the
sixteenth century the University of Louvain played an
unparalleled part in the intellectual life of Belgium.</p>

<p>Such was the splendid achievement of Belgian culture
in the times of the Burgundian dukes. The untimely
death of Charles the Bold on the battlefield of Nancy
threatened ruin to the marvelous results of their policy.
The news of his death was scarcely made public when the
strong Burgundian state he dreamed of collapsed. Lorraine,
Alsace, and the neighboring countries regained their
independence, Liège threw off the yoke, and the shrewd
Louis XI, notwithstanding the treaties, annexed the
cities of the Somme and of Picardy to France, conquered
Artois, and took possession of the duchy of Burgundy and
of the Franche-Comté.</p>

<p>This was a disastrous beginning for the young daughter
of Charles the Bold, Mary of Burgundy. It was necessary
that she be married and so obtain a protector as
promptly as possible. The States-General accepted the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
candidacy of Maximilian of Hapsburg, son of the Emperor
Frederick III of Germany. That marriage laid
the foundation for the European supremacy of the house
of Hapsburg, and gave to Belgium a dynasty which remained
in power until the French Revolution.</p>

<p>Prior to the marriage of Mary, the States-General had
taken advantage of the disastrous situation in which
the young princess found herself, and wrested from her
the so-called “Grand Privilege” (February 11, 1477),
whereby the Parliament of Malines was abolished and a
“Grand Council” was established, with limited power and
including representatives of all the Belgian provinces.
At the same time, each principality succeeded in obtaining
collective provincial privileges. Thus most of the
new institutions and rules introduced by the Burgundian
dukes were abolished, and the former privileges of the
communes were again recognized. After the death of
Princess Mary (1482), the reaction of the communes
became even more violent. A son named Philip had been
born to Mary and Maximilian; history knows him as
Philip the Fair. The Belgians immediately recognized
the infant archduke, but they continued the fight against
his father Maximilian. After a bloody struggle in which
both France (assisting Flanders) and Germany (assisting
Maximilian) interfered, victory remained in the hands of
the Hapsburgs (1492).</p>

<p>The resistance of the Flemish communes to autocracy
and centralization was henceforth shattered. Broken
and impoverished, they no longer questioned the authority
of the prince. Philip the Fair and Charles V continued
at peace and achieved the work of monarchic centralization
initiated by the Burgundian dukes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">BELGIUM UNDER CHARLES V (1506-55) AND THE
BEGINNINGS OF THE HOUSE OF HAPSBURG</p>

<p>Philip the Fair was made duke and count of the different
Belgian principalities in 1494. Meanwhile the
international situation in Europe had become dangerous
for Spain and the Empire. Charles VIII of France had
conquered the countries of Milan and Naples. The
Hapsburgs and the King of Spain, threatened by the
common danger, united against the policy of France and
strengthened the coalition by the marriage of Don Juan,
heir to the Spanish throne, to the daughter of Maximilian
of Hapsburg, and the union of the latter’s son, Philip
the Fair, with the Spanish infanta, Jeanne. As all the
heirs to the Spanish throne died in a short space of time,
Jeanne inherited all the rights, and Philip the Fair, sovereign
of the Netherlands, became King of Spain.</p>

<p>This event proved of the utmost importance in the
history of Belgium. Although regarded as a separate
territory, the Netherlands—both Belgium and Holland—became
a mere annex of the Spanish branch of the Hapsburg
monarchy. For more than two centuries Belgium
was ruled from Madrid by sovereigns who were first of
all kings of Spain.</p>

<p>This was not yet, however, the case in the time of
Charles V, the great emperor of the sixteenth century.
Archduke Charles, son of Philip the Fair, known as Charles
V at the time of his accession as Emperor in 1519, assumed
control of the Netherlands in 1515. The latter included<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
Belgium and Holland, in addition to the county of Artois,
and was commonly spoken of as the Seventeen Provinces.
The following year (1516) Charles also became King of
Spain. His reign was occupied by protracted wars with
France, constituting a continuous strife with the powerful
sovereign for the hegemony of Europe. In the course of
this struggle the Netherlands were continually attacked
by Francis I, the French King, and his allies, the Duke
of Gueldre, and the La Marcks, Lords of Sedan and Bouillon.
The advantage was always with Charles, however,
and he was thus enabled to continue the territorial concentration
of all the provinces of the Netherlands which
was begun by the dukes of Burgundy.</p>

<p>Peacefully or by force, Charles successively annexed
East Friesland, Tournai and Tournaisis, the Overyssel,
Groninge and Ommelanden, Gueldre and Zutphen to
his domains. In the ecclesiastical principalities, which
the Burgundian dukes had never been able to annex but
only to control, Charles succeeded in winning the temporal
power in the bishopric of Utrecht; destroyed Térouanne,
the seat of the bishopric of the same name; erected Cambrai
and Cambrésis into a duchy in favor of the bishop;
and purchased part of the principality of Liège, where
he built strong fortresses.</p>

<p>After these achievements, Charles V could call himself
the mightiest sovereign in Europe. But a very intricate
question yet remained to be settled, namely, what the
political relation of the Netherlands should be toward
the Empire. The feudal tie between the Empire and the
provinces, called into existence while Lotharingia was
yet a fief, had never, theoretically at least, been broken;
and at the beginning of the sixteenth century Germany<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
still affected to recognize the union (the feudal vassalage)
of the provinces with the Empire, in order that they
might be the more easily compelled to share in the
heavy financial burdens of the latter. The Netherlands,
on the other hand, maintained that the union no
longer existed. The question was a difficult one for
Charles, he being at the same time German Emperor and
sovereign of the Netherlands. It took him twenty-five
years of negotiations. In 1548, after his victory over
the princes of the Protestant League at Schmalkalden,
he settled the question by the celebrated Augsburg
transaction.</p>

<p>By this provisional arrangement the Empire was
divided into “circles.” The episcopal duchy of Cambrai,
Liège, and the small principality of Stavelot-Malmedy
became a part of the so-called circle of Westphalia; the
Seventeen Provinces of the Netherlands and the Franche-Comté
constituted a new circle, called the “circle of
Bourgogne.” These states were placed under the armed
protection of the Empire, which undertook to defend
them as members of the whole. They were recognized,
however, as independent and free states, not subject to
the laws of the Empire. At the same time, fearing that,
through the application of the varying rules of succession
existing in each Belgian principality, the union might
some day become imperiled, Charles V, by a special act,
ordained that the Netherlands or Seventeen Provinces
should forever be considered an indivisible whole, in
which the first-born son should be regarded as the heir
to the throne. In case of deficiency of a male heir, however,
the female heir was to be recognized in the succession.
This was really a constitutional law sanctioned by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
the States-General, officially gathered in solemn meeting
in Brussels in 1549. The early work of the dukes of
Burgundy was now completed and firmly established.</p>

<p>Another task of tremendous importance now engaged
the attention of Charles. This was the fight against
heresy. The new difficulty presented an entirely novel
problem.</p>

<p>When, by the revolt of Luther against the Roman
Catholic church, Protestantism began rapidly to spread
all over Europe, it quickly found a follower in the Netherlands,
whose location facilitated its expansion. In virtue
of their historical development, the Netherlands are an
essentially Catholic state. Charles V and Philip II, as
sovereigns of that state, considered themselves the
defenders of orthodoxy, religious unity, and the union
of church and state. In opposing what they considered
to be a political as well as a religious crime, they invoked
the penal laws and criminal institutions as their weapons
against what they regarded as a revolutionary movement.</p>

<p>The famous <i>placarts</i>, or penal laws, enacted under
Charles V to the number of a dozen between 1520 and
1530, were complementary to each other. They were
all the work of the government and were approved by the
States-General, the prominent members of the military
aristocracy, and the knights of the Golden Fleece. They
were preventive and repressive at the same time. From
a repressive point of view, they distinguished between
the crime of heresy and the simple offense against the
prescriptions of the <i>placarts</i>.</p>

<p>The crime of heresy could be committed only by a man
who had been baptized, who from the point of view of the
Catholic faith was guilty of error, and who obstinately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
persisted in that error after having been warned and
enlightened. Obstinacy in error was the main point. If
there was no obstinacy, but retraction of the error, there
was no more crime; there remained only a sin. On the
other hand, a simple offense against the <i>placarts</i> might
be committed by anyone, be he a Catholic, a Jew, or a
heretic. Such offenses might be committed, for instance,
by <i>acts</i>, such as the circulation of heretic books and
pamphlets, by sheltering meetings of heretics, etc.</p>

<p>The crime of heresy was to be judged by an ecclesiastical
judge, the only one able to discuss those matters.
The offense against the <i>placarts</i> was to be dealt with
by a secular judge, a layman. The jurisdiction of the
ecclesiastical judge was limited by strict rules. He
might not impose a penalty prescribed by the <i>placarts</i>,
or any penalty involving the shedding of blood. If the
heretic remained obstinate, he was to be expelled from
the church and given over to the lay judge, who alone
might impose the penalty prescribed by the <i>placarts</i>.</p>

<p>The latter penalties were simple and drastic: death
by fire, by sword, or by burial alive, and the confiscation
of property. The system inaugurated by Charles was
anti-judicial and cruel. It was anti-judicial, inasmuch as
the penalties were applied both to heretics and to simple
offenders against the <i>placarts</i>, and thus provided similar
punishment for offenses whose intrinsic criminality was
wholly different. It must not, however, be forgotten
that in the sixteenth century the object of every penal
law was to instil terror first of all, and that those guilty
of heresy were considered as seditious persons, disturbers
of the state, and consequently to be punished by the
severe penalties applicable to acts of <i>lèse-majesté</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span></p>

<p>Special officers were appointed for enforcing the
<i>placarts</i>. These were the so-called “Apostolic Inquisitors”
whom Charles V requested the Pope to appoint in
1524. They were only ecclesiastical judges, receiving
their instructions directly from the Holy See. Their
mission consisted in discovering the heretics, in reconciling
them with the church, and in imposing only a canon or
ecclesiastical penalty. If the heretic remained obstinate,
they were obliged to turn him over to the lay judge. For
the first time, in 1546, they received detailed instructions
from the Emperor and after that were considered as
agents of the state.</p>

<p>Another measure designed to prevent the spread of
heresy was the establishment of the new dioceses, but as
this was undertaken by Philip II we shall deal with it
in another chapter. It remains only to add that throughout
the reign of Charles V the system of the <i>placarts</i> met
with no opposition. The Emperor was a Fleming, he
was born at Ghent, he knew his people, and the people
accepted from him what they would not accept from his
son Philip some years later.</p>

<p>Owing to these circumstances, Charles V was able to
complete the work of the Burgundian dukes in another
direction, namely, the monarchic centralization of the
Belgian provinces. The numerous wars waged by him
involved expenses, and, under the rights theretofore
granted the country, he was obliged to obtain the consent
of the States-General, called together for the purpose,
whenever he required the financial assistance of his subjects.
In granting the subsidies, the States-General
invariably seized on the occasion for exacting some privilege
or concession in return. In order to free himself of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
this restraint, the Emperor sought to introduce two innovations,
which, in France, had practically destroyed the
power of the States-General, namely, the permanent
impost and the permanent army. To his sister, Mary of
Hungary, who in his name governed the Netherlands, he
intrusted the proposal of a clever scheme. All the
provinces of the Netherlands were to form a defensive
union or confederation, in order to be ready to repel the
attacks from foreign princes. Should a province be
attacked, all the other provinces were immediately to
join in assisting it from a military and financial point
of view. Such common action would involve the existence
of a permanent army and the introduction of a
permanent tax.</p>

<p>When the proposal was laid before them, the States-General
immediately discovered the trap. Some of them
even dared to remark that they did not want to be treated
<i>à la mode de France</i>. The scheme was unequivocally
rejected. The Emperor was obliged to yield. He was
far too diplomatic openly and brutally to oppose the
privileges of his subjects.</p>

<p>In 1555 he abdicated and went to pass the rest of his
life in the Spanish monastery of Saint Just. His son,
Philip II of Spain, succeeded him as sovereign of the
Netherlands.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">PHILIP II AND THE REVOLT OF THE NETHERLANDS
AGAINST SPANISH RULE (1555-96)</p>

<p>The revolt of the Netherlands against Spain is not
merely an event of local Belgian history; it belongs to
the political history of Europe. It is an episode of those
long and cruel wars of religion which, beginning in Scotland
after the constitution of the first Presbyterian
Covenant, set aflame the whole of Western Europe. Of
course, the occasion for the wars differed in each country,
but the cause was the same in every case and the question
which was to be supreme in Europe, Catholicism or
Protestantism, actuated them all. In this tremendous
struggle all questions were finally reduced to one, and as
social influences aligned themselves on one side or the
other, the tide turned in favor of or against the church.
Catholics and Protestants supported their brethren in
the faith on the other side of the frontiers. Each side
sought a decisive victory; divided influence or co-ordinate
recognition was acceptable to neither. Timid
persons and politicians seeking to remain neutral were
carried away by the current or submerged by it. Neutrality
was impossible; everyone was forced to take part in
the struggle.</p>

<p>The kings of France, lacking principles and decision,
found their own forces divided and were unable to carry
out a real international policy. On the other hand,
Elizabeth, Queen of England, resolutely ranged herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
on the side of international Protestantism, assisting
and often directing its attacks. Against her, Philip II
of Spain, considering himself as the absolute defender
of Catholicism in Europe, set his nationality and his
faith. Lacking decision in political matters, he showed
no indecision in matters of faith. Against him arose
the league of Protestants throughout Europe. They
realized that, if he was defeated and his country crushed,
the church would be defeated throughout the world. The
Protestants therefore concentrated their attack on him
in the Netherlands. The geographical position of the
latter made interference with England, France, and
Germany especially feasible; but they were at the same
time the weakest spots in Philip’s dominions. Revolt
blazed within their borders—such revolt as might result
in bringing his power to an end. This Philip realized
full well, and determined to go to any limit in order
to keep the Netherlands. Nothing was left undone
which would serve to suppress every attempt at revolt.
This object it was which dictated his unhappy policy in
the Netherlands, a policy that resulted in the loss of the
northern part, and ultimately in the founding of the
separate state of the United Provinces (Holland).</p>

<p>The true meaning of the wars of religion in the Netherlands
cannot be properly understood without taking these
considerations into account. It will also be useful to
consider the characters of those prominently involved
in the tragedy, before narrating the details of the tragedy
itself.</p>

<p>Philip II, King of Spain and sovereign of the Netherlands,
was above all a Spaniard. Educated in Spain, he
found himself unable to understand the Belgians as his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
father had. He did not appreciate their pride, their
deep love of liberty, and their respect for the privileges
granted them. An autocratic king, he was haughty as
only a Spaniard can be. Deeply convinced of the superiority
of Catholicism, and possessing principles absolutely
rigid in character, he was incapable of compromise—in
short, a real bigot. In political affairs he endeavored
to arrange every detail himself, and personally to read
piles of dispatches by the light of a candle in his dark
room in the Escurial. He labored day and night, constantly
immersed in thought, and was remarkably slow
in reaching a decision. When, however, his mind was
finally made up, it was usually too late. Events had
progressed in the meantime and when his orders reached
the theater of war they could not be carried out, since
the situation had entirely changed. That slowness of
decision brought him many disasters. Nevertheless, he
was an excellent father to his children, and there are
extant letters written by him to his daughters, in which
it is difficult to recognize the lonely thinker of the
Escurial.</p>

<p>He paid a short visit to his subjects in the Netherlands
at the beginning of his reign (1557), but left no sympathetic
impression behind. His sister, Duchess Margareta
of Parma, remained in the country to govern
the people during his absence. He was absent to the
end. His Flemish subjects never saw him again. From
Madrid he directed the affairs of the Belgians, and
studied the dispatches which reached him every week.</p>

<p>Margareta, offspring of the amour of Emperor Charles
V with the daughter of a Flemish upholsterer from Audenaerde,
had been educated for a time in Brussels and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
then gone to Italy, where she successively married Alessandro
de’ Medici and Ottavio Farnese, the latter being
Duke of Parma and Piacenza. Although of masculine
character, loving sport and exercises, Margareta possessed
the feminine characteristics of vanity and shrewdness.
She had acquired in Italy a disposition to engage in
<i>combinazione</i>, and succeeded in playing the game often
under very difficult circumstances. Philip of Spain left
her as an assistant in her political councils a man of real
diplomacy, Cardinal de Granvelle.</p>

<p>Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle, Burgundian in origin,
was a loyal servant of his master. He was the man of
the <i>raison d’état</i>. Philip II never had a more faithful
minister. Granvelle desired only the welfare of the King
and of the state he represented, and was heroic enough
to assume the responsibility for the drastic measures
taken by his sovereign. He was a man of real political
genius, clear-sighted, absolutely unselfish. The main
object of his political plans was that Spain should rule
the seas, and it was he who urged Philip II to send the
famous Armada against England.</p>

<p>When Philip II began his reign in the Netherlands,
the financial situation of the government was distressing.
Charles V had left heavy debts created by his numerous
wars. Public opinion was defiant, influenced as it was
by ill will for the unsympathetic King and by the baseless
fear that the scheme of erecting new dioceses would be
the precursor of the terrible Spanish Inquisition.</p>

<p>The scheme of erecting new dioceses had been conceived
by the King in 1559, in order to counteract more
strongly the propaganda of Protestantism. The existing
mediaeval dioceses were too large to enable the bishops<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
to carry out their mission as guardians of the faith. It
was necessary, therefore, that the old dioceses be broken
up and divided into smaller ones, so that the bishops
would have more opportunity for action in smaller areas.
The Pope consented, and permitted the erection of
thirteen new dioceses. From an ecclesiastical point of
view the country was now divided as follows: the archbishopric
of Malines, with the suffragan dioceses, Antwerp,
Bois-le-Duc, Ghent, Ypres, Bruges, Ruremonde;
the archbishopric of Cambrai, with the suffragans, Arras,
Tournai, Namur, Saint-Omer; the archbishopric of
Utrecht, with the suffragans, Haerlem, Deventer, Leeuwarden,
Middelburg, Groninge. The scheme stirred
up violent opposition among the Belgian nobles, the
abbots, some of the bishops, and even among the common
people. The nobles feared the loss of their political
influence through the admission of so many bishops into
the States-General, where they would occupy leading
positions. Many of the abbots were resentful because
their monasteries would be compelled to contribute to
the new bishops a part of their income, in support of the
new dioceses. Some of the bishops were angered over
the division of their former dioceses and the reduction of
their spiritual power. The people, influenced by political
agents and Protestant propagandists, were led to believe
that each new bishop would simply be a representative
of the Spanish Inquisition.</p>

<p>The movement of opposition would have been easily
repressed by the Belgian nobles had they really been
faithful to the King. But, on the whole, they were not.
They had the same feelings as the French aristocracy at this
time. They were horrified at the idea of the supremacy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
of the sovereign power. Although not possessing any
definite aim, they tried to dominate the Prince and the
state by means of the political power they themselves
controlled. They were members of the Council of State,
governors of the different Belgian provinces, captains
in the national army, the famous <i>bandes d’ordonnance</i>,
and they exercised a tremendous influence on all classes.
The political difficulties encountered by the government
were for them but favorable opportunities of which to
take advantage. The King himself afforded them a
chance. With characteristic disregard for the national
privileges, he established at Brussels a council called the
<i>Consulta</i>, an institution of true Spanish type. Composed
of a few individuals, it was dominated by the influence
of Cardinal de Granvelle, and undertook to decide the
most important questions of national policy. The <i>Consulta</i>
stirred up an opposition of formidable character,
guided by the most influential Belgian nobles, the Prince
of Orange and the counts of Egmont and Horn. Cardinal
de Granvelle became the victim of the most violent
attacks. Margareta of Parma first sought to defend
him, but, little by little, influenced by the nobles, she
finally ranged herself on their side and herself requested
the King to recall the unsympathetic minister. Partly
through weariness, partly through political miscalculation,
Philip II yielded. Granvelle left the Netherlands.</p>

<p>This was a triumph for the opposition. Margareta,
who had been moved by jealousy of Granvelle and
who had hoped to add materially to her power after his
departure, fell more and more under the control of the
nobles, who flattered her and took advantage of her
feminine vanity. A reign of anarchy and favoritism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
followed, the friends of the nobles being furnished with
offices and perquisites. The political opponents of the
King now tried to consolidate and to perpetuate their
success. They asked that all affairs be subject to the
control of the Council of State, the real national body of
which they themselves were the masters; that he should
convoke the States-General, and that he should temper
the <i>placarts</i> against the heretics and abolish the power
of the Inquisitors. The granting of the first of these
demands would have made the nobles all-powerful in
political affairs. From the second measure—the meeting
of the States-General—they expected ratification of their
conduct and popular support of the opposition they had
inaugurated. In dealing with the question of the <i>placarts</i>,
they played a sort of religious policy calculated to bring
them the support of the Lutherans and the Calvinists.</p>

<p>Philip II rejected their demands. Astonished by this
resistance, which they did not expect after the capitulation
of the King on the question of Granvelle, some of the
Belgian nobles, and especially the Prince of Orange, succeeded
in embroiling the Protestant sectarians in the
struggle. The Calvinists, more warlike than the Lutherans,
were more than ready to join the movement, owing
to their hatred of the Catholic King of Spain. But, once
begun, the movement became an irresistible one. Stirred
up by their preachers and assisted by the worst elements
of the populace, the Calvinists invaded the churches,
smashed the statues of the saints, carried away the
treasures, attacked the convents, and killed monks and
priests (1566). The Belgian nobles, surprised by the
revolt they had so imprudently initiated, were unable to
stop it; rather they were submerged by the current.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
From this time onward the political anti-Spanish movement
became a part of the general movement of the wars
of religion. Many Catholics foresaw what would happen
and deserted the cause, separating themselves from a
revolt that was being directed as much against the church
as against Spanish rule.</p>

<p>From the revolt of 1566 and the outrages of the sectarians
resulted the later policy of Philip II toward the
Netherlands. Hitherto he had but followed the traditional
policy of his father, Emperor Charles. He had
showed respect for political institutions; he had avoided
any cause of rupture. He had tried, of course unwillingly
and unskilfully, to satisfy public opinion. His patience
brought him nothing but a serious check. He had recalled,
in 1561, the Spanish garrisons which had been quartered
in Belgium during the war with France; he had sacrificed
his loyal minister Granvelle and had capitulated to
the nobles. But the more he showed himself to be
conciliatory the more audacious became the opposition.
This was at first purely political and aimed only at the
reconstruction of the Burgundian state as against the
Spanish state; later, it had dared to claim liberty of
conscience, an unheard-of thing at this period; finally,
it had favored the Calvinistic agitation and had caused
the desecration of convents and churches.</p>

<p>When the news of this outrage reached the King, he
angrily exclaimed: “By the soul of my father, for these
crimes they shall pay a heavy price.” In the eyes of
Philip II, official protector of Catholicism, both the royal
and the divine majesty had been insulted, and the claim
for autonomy had but aggravated the triumph of heresy.
His rebellious subjects were to be chastised. He would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
impose political absolutism upon them as well as the
religious control that prevailed in Spain. The iron rule
he intended to introduce would preserve for the church
and for himself those countries which were the cornerstones
of his world-power.</p>

<p>From now on we may speak of the “Spanish rule.”
The traditionally lax policy of Emperor Charles was gone.
The tyranny of Spain was destined to crush the Belgians.
That task was intrusted to the Duke of Alva, who came
to Belgium as governor in 1567. Don Luis Alvarez de
Toledo, Duke of Alva and Marquess of Soria, was a cold
and implacable warrior. The greatness of his king was
for him the greatness of Spain. He hated the Belgians,
who had dared to ask for liberty of conscience, as much
as he hated the heretics. He accomplished his terrible
mission unwaveringly and remorselessly; his method of
government was terror. Accustomed to fight the Moslem
Moors of Spain, he knew only two weapons with which
to crush the heretics—the sword and the stake. He
wrote in one of his letters: “It is infinitely better to
keep, by means of war, for God and for the King, an
impoverished and even ruined country, than to keep it,
without war, undamaged, for the devil and his partisans,
the heretics.”</p>

<p>Such was the terrible warrior to whom Philip II
intrusted a double task: to chastise the rebels and heretics
and to subject the nation to the rule of Madrid. Alva
arrived in Belgium with a large number of the best Spanish
troops. Contrary to all customs in the free Netherlands,
they were billeted in the cities. A fortress was ordered
built at Antwerp. The counts of Egmont and Horn and
the burgomaster of Antwerp were treacherously arrested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
and imprisoned. But the real leader of the opposition,
the Prince of Orange, could not be taken. More clear-sighted
than his friends, he had fled to Holland before
the coming vengeance. In defiance of all national privileges,
Alva established an extraordinary tribunal, which
the people soon called the “Council of Blood”; that
court of justice, established and conducted in a thoroughly
revolutionary manner, condemned scores of people who
were more or less guilty of revolt against the King. About
two thousand victims were sentenced to death and executed.
Only political crimes were taken into account, and
the condemnation was followed by the confiscation of
property—a remarkably remunerative operation for the
Spanish treasure chest. Terror fell upon the Belgians.
All who had engaged in the slightest degree in the revolt
of 1566 fled to foreign countries; Lutherans and Calvinists,
panic-stricken, left the Netherlands in large
numbers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Prince of Orange had sought for help
among the German Protestant princes; he gathered an
army and invaded Belgium. He had expected a general
revolt of the people against Alva at the first news of his
campaign. But the soldiers of his army, merely hirelings,
and many of them fanatical Protestants, pillaged churches
and convents on their way; they disgusted the naturally
religious populace of Belgium, and the campaign of
William the Silent proved a complete failure. The prince
was compelled to seek refuge in France, where he hoped
to get help from Coligny and the French Huguenots.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">ANTWERP<br> The oldest part of the city, the Scheldt, and the Town Hall</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>By way of reply to this misadventure of William the
Silent came the execution of the counts of Egmont and
Horn. The “Council of Blood” charged them with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>high treason and ordered them to be put to death, on the
Place du Sablon, in the heart of Brussels. Their death
stupefied the people and disheartened the nationalists.
Both counts fell victims to the hatred of the terrible duke,
for they were guilty only of weakness and imprudence—they
never really were traitors to their sovereign. The
Belgians always regarded them as martyrs for their
country. Alva now proceeded to introduce into the
Netherlands the features of the Spanish régime, while
his condemnations continued. For the first time since
1561 the new bishops were able to occupy their bishoprics,
the Catholic faith was everywhere re-established,
the University of Louvain was visited in order to determine
whether it was sufficiently orthodox, the Council of
State was no more called together or given over to Spaniards.
In order to secure supplies and money for his
administration and to crush the country economically,
Alva introduced unheard-of taxes, called the <i>centième,
vingtième, et dixième denier</i>. This meant a permanent
impost, which the Belgians had always stoutly resisted.
A revolt broke out all over the country. What the
appeals of William the Silent did not effect, the attack
upon the people’s privileges and wealth did. The Prince
of Orange cleverly took advantage of it, and, needing the
help of the heretics to fight the enemy, gave the direction
of the movement into the hands of the Calvinists.
Meanwhile a storm of recrimination and complaints,
among which the protests of the bishops and of the
University of Louvain were not the weakest, reached
Philip II. The King understood that he had gone to work
the wrong way, and that the policy of terrorism had not
brought him any real success. He changed his mind and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
recalled Alva. The terrible duke left Belgium pursued
by the maledictions of the whole people.</p>

<p>His successor, Don Luis de Requesens, was a better
man. The change in the King’s attitude was immediately
revealed by the measures taken by the new governor.
Requesens abolished the “Council of Blood,” proclaimed
a general amnesty, and opened negotiations at Breda
with the rebellious provinces. These negotiations failed,
however, and the struggle continued on both sides with
alternating successes and reverses. Requesens died suddenly
in 1575, at a moment when the government was
facing an appalling financial crisis. The Council of State
immediately took over the regency, till the King should
send a new governor.</p>

<p>The Prince of Orange, however, had decided that there
should be no peace and that the revolutionary movement
should be agitated as much as possible. He had completely
gained the confidence of Holland and Zeeland,
where he was the real master, and he planned to extend his
control over the rest of the Seventeen Provinces. Deeply
compromised as he was, any agreement with the King
would mean disaster and the end of his plans, which
aimed at the separation of the Belgian provinces from the
Spanish monarchy. Owing to personal circumstances
he had first endeavored to resist Philip II by legal means.
During his exile and under the government of Alva he
had gone farther and had planned a general revolt, and
now that the milder attitude of the King threatened to
win back some sympathy in Belgium, especially among
the Catholics, he foresaw that only the most daring policy
would save the revolutionary movement. Agents were
therefore sent to the southern provinces to stir up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
people against any attempt at conciliation. As a result
of their intrigues, the members of the Council of State
were arrested by a furious mob and imprisoned. By
the time they were liberated they had fallen completely
under the influence of the revolutionary leaders. The
States-General were called together by the friendly members
of the Council of State, and for nine years exercised
the chief power in Belgium. It was during their government,
which proved on the whole to be Catholic and
loyalist, that the Spanish soldiers, deprived of their pay,
arose and sacked the city of Antwerp, killing nearly seven
thousand people. This event is known as the “Spanish
Fury.”</p>

<p>This, of course, gave the anti-Spanish party an excellent
chance. Under the pressure of William the Silent,
the States-General met at Ghent in 1575, and out of
their deliberations was born the famous “Pacification of
Ghent.” This act was the work of the Prince of Orange,
and was intended to reconcile Catholics and Protestants
and to settle their religious differences, in order that they
might be united in the political struggle against Spain.
This attempt at establishing a “peace of religion” was
unfortunately premature and provisional. The hostilities
between Catholics and Protestants were suspended
and religious tolerance was proclaimed; but in Holland
and Zeeland, the political sphere of influence of the Prince
of Orange, the Catholic worship was provisionally forbidden.
The States-General would, it was promised,
later on reconsider the whole problem and settle the
religious differences definitely. This agreement was, of
course, unfavorable to the Catholics, but union was
temporarily restored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Don Juan, the new Spanish governor, had
been appointed by Philip II and had arrived in Belgium.
Don Juan was the son of Charles V, and the celebrated
victor over the Turks in the naval battle of Lepanto
(1571). He had no sympathy for the Belgians and did
not like the task which was intrusted to him. He
attempted, of course, though against his convictions, to
negotiate with the rebels, but failed. As we have seen,
the Prince of Orange had determined that there should
be no peace until his plans had been carried out. By
surprising and occupying the fortress of Namur, contrary
to the conventions but in order to obtain a stronghold
for his protection, Don Juan played, as a matter of fact,
into the hands of his enemies. Under the influence of
William the Silent the States-General declared the governor
a traitor to the country, and called upon Archduke
Mathias, brother of Emperor Rodolphe, to be their new
governor. Mathias became practically an instrument
in the hands of the Prince of Orange, who was appointed
as his lieutenant-general.</p>

<p>Now followed a period of anarchy and misrule.
Germany, England, and France sent into Belgium a
host of sectarians and adventurers; these aided the
Calvinists in taking Brussels, Antwerp, and Ghent.
Ghent became the center of a Calvinistic republic,
where the leaders ruled by terror and began a rigorous
persecution of the Catholics. It was now quite clear
that the Protestants had gained the upper hand in
the struggle and that the national revolt had turned
into a war against Catholicism. In the midst of these
troubles, Don Juan of Austria died at Bouges, near
Namur (1578).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span></p>

<p>At this very moment, events of great importance took
place. The Prince of Orange, contrary to the provisions
of the Pacification of Ghent, had again endeavored to
introduce a new “peace of religion,” which had for its
object the introduction of Protestantism into the Belgian
provinces other than Holland and Zeeland. The
Protestant ministers rejected his proposal. What they
wanted was not co-ordinate recognition of Catholicism
and Protestantism, but the complete supremacy of their
own religion. Seeing that his attempts brought about
only discontent of both parties, Catholics and Protestants,
William the Silent finally declared himself openly as a
Calvinist (1578). His rupture with the Catholics was
now complete.</p>

<p>This induced the southern provinces, where Catholicism
was still in control, to withdraw their support and to
reconcile themselves with the Spanish King. The sole
motive of this decision was a religious one. There could
be no talk of hostility between the Walloons of the south
and the Flemings of the north. This was not a question
of racial or linguistic difference. The people of Artois,
Hainaut, and French Flanders were disgusted at the
excesses committed by the Calvinists of Ghent and the
position taken by William the Silent in religious matters.
The Catholic spirit of Belgium, imposed on the country
ever since the Middle Ages, weighed more strongly in
their minds than their national hostility to the Spanish
rule. Moreover, two other provinces which joined them—Namur
and Luxemburg—had never taken part in the
revolt. As we have seen, the province of Brabant,
more independent than any other, and, since the fourteenth
century, determined in its opposition to foreign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
interference, had taken the real leadership in the struggle
against Spain.</p>

<p>The movement in the south in favor of a reconciliation
with Philip II was an essentially popular movement.
The nobles of Artois and Hainaut still wavered in their
sympathies.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The clever policy of the new governor,
Alexander Farnese, who succeeded Don Juan of Austria
after the death of the latter (1578), overcame their last
hesitation.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Alexander Farnese was the son of Margareta of Parma,
who had formerly governed the Netherlands. He was of
a sympathetic nature, loyal, honest, but firm. He was
one of the greatest warriors of his age, but at the same
time, being an Italian prince, he distinguished himself as
a very shrewd diplomat. At last Philip II had found the
right man to govern the Netherlands. Alexander Farnese,
highly approved by Cardinal de Granvelle—who
at this time resided in Madrid—inaugurated a policy of
mildness and conciliation that produced the happiest
results. He induced the nobles of the southern provinces,
and especially the Count of Lalaing, to abandon their
scruples and to return to the service of the King. Both
clever diplomacy and gifts and promises of large sums
of money played a part in these achievements. From
these negotiations resulted the Treaty of Arras (1579),
concluded between the representatives of Artois, Hainaut,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>Luxemburg, Namur, and French Flanders and the new
governor, as a consequence of which the southern provinces
returned to the allegiance of Philip II. A concession
made by Farnese was that the foreign troops,
which had for so many years pillaged and ruined the
country, should leave Belgium.</p>

<p>The Treaty of Arras resulted in the reconquest, without
bloodshed, of the southern part of Belgium; it provoked
a rupture between Catholics and Protestants, the
separation of the Walloons and the Flemings, and crushed
the plans of the Prince of Orange. Henceforth it would
be no longer possible to unite the whole of Belgium against
Spanish rule. William the Silent replied to the Treaty
of Arras by the so-called Union of Utrecht (1579), whereby
the northern provinces of the Netherlands united
themselves in the common struggle and decided to carry
on the revolt to ultimate victory. Slowly, but surely,
the secession of Belgium from Holland was in progress.</p>

<p>The Prince of Orange, infuriated by the blow inflicted
on his policy, now proclaimed the forfeiture by Philip II
of the sovereignty of the Netherlands and offered the
crown to the Duke of Anjou, brother of the French King
Henry III (1584). He himself received the title of governor
of Holland and Zeeland and remained the real leader
of the union. Philip II replied by declaring the Prince
an outlaw and putting a price on his head. Such an
appeal to murder was common in the sixteenth century
and was even supported by the teaching of many theorists;
today it seems cruel and opposed to every principle of
civilization. A man fanatical enough to fulfil the desire
of the Spanish King was soon found. Balthazar Gérard
treacherously assassinated the Prince of Orange at Delft,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
in 1584. So died the leader of the revolt of the Netherlands
against Spain. He did not succeed in uniting the
whole of Belgium against Philip II, but he initiated the
United Provinces of Holland. The Dutch are right,
therefore, in calling him the “Father of the Fatherland.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, supported by the Catholic provinces,
Alexander Farnese had successively reconquered all the
Belgian cities and won an imperishable fame by the siege
and conquest of Antwerp. Only Ostend resisted and
could not be taken. It seemed now to be the turn of the
north, and already the United Provinces were threatened
with invasion, when the unwise policy of Philip II suddenly
stopped the advance. The lonely autocrat of the
Escurial had planned the invasion of England and the
conquest of the throne of France, where Henry IV, a
Protestant but the legitimate heir, was at war with the
Catholic League. To these plans he sacrificed all the
resources of Spain from 1587 to 1592 and forced Farnese
to suspend his campaign in Flanders, to assist in the
transport of troops for the invasion of England, and to
aid with his army the League in France. Both enterprises
failed utterly, the invasion of England by the
defeat of the Spanish Armada, the conquest of the French
throne by the final rally of the country to the support
of Henry IV.</p>

<p>The obstinacy of Philip II caused the loss of the
northern part of the Netherlands, which Farnese would
probably have conquered. Alexander Farnese died in
1592 and at his death the Spanish King lost the best
governor he had ever had in Belgium. The last years
of the sixteenth century were unhappy years for the
country. The long and bloody struggle had utterly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
ruined the land. The population had been reduced by at
least 50 per cent; churches and civic buildings had been
burned or severely damaged; trade and industry were
in large part gone; Antwerp had lost its commerce, and
thousands of people engaged in trade had fled to England,
Germany, or Holland. Artistic and literary activity had
come to a complete standstill; and the scientific center
of Belgium, the University of Louvain, barely escaped
complete ruin.</p>

<p>But Belgium remained Catholic and subject to the
Spanish branch of the Hapsburgs, while the United
Provinces (of Holland), overwhelmingly Protestant, had
in fact become an independent country. Henceforth
Belgium and Holland went each its own way, and their
history no longer records common interests, at least until
the period of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands
(1814).</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE REIGN OF THE ARCHDUKE ALBERT AND
ISABELLA (1598-1633)</p>

<p>Finally, convinced after a long and painful experience
that peace was to be restored to Belgium only by new
means and other methods than those heretofore employed,
and that by waging war he would not be able to win
back the northern provinces, Philip II tried another
plan. He thought that by giving national sovereigns
to the Catholic provinces he might induce the Protestants
of Holland to return to their former allegiance and thus
restore the lost unity of the Netherlands. In 1598 he
decided, shortly before his death, that the Netherlands
should be erected into an independent state, whose
crown he gave to his daughter Isabella, after she had
married Archduke Albert of Austria. If she and her
consort should have no children, the Belgian provinces
were to return to Spain. This was an important decision,
although nobody in Europe believed in the real independence
of Belgium. The country was practically under
Spanish influence. But autonomy, at least, existed.</p>

<p>Strange to say, the satisfaction felt by the Belgians
was at first mingled with some disappointment. As
Albert and Isabella were obliged, as sovereigns of “the
Netherlands,” to continue the war against the northern
provinces in order to unite them with those in the south
already under their power, the Belgians feared that they
would be charged with the heavy burden of war, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
this time without the aid of the Spanish finances and
of the Spanish army. But Philip II had foreseen the
difficulty. He sent the famous general Spinola to their
assistance, with an army of excellent Spanish troops.</p>

<p>At first Archduke Albert initiated negotiations with
the United Provinces, but his proposals were received
with contempt. He was forced to make war. A bloody
battle was fought at Nieuport, where the Archduke
courageously led his troops against the Dutch under
Maurice of Nassau. Although not victorious, Albert
decided to besiege Ostend, the only Belgian city left in
the hands of the rebels. The siege of Ostend lasted three
years, from 1601 to 1604. On both sides deeds of heroism
were numerous. Three rings of fortifications had to be
taken and every trench was stormed at the cost of many
lives. At length Ostend, continuously battered by
artillery, could no longer resist the energetic assaults
of the soldiers of Spinola. It surrendered, but only its
ruins were left in the hands of the victor.</p>

<p>After the fall of Ostend, the Archduke, wishing to
put an end to this war of exhaustion, again opened negotiations
with the United Provinces, and succeeded in
concluding a truce for twelve years (1609-21). During
that time Albert and Isabella did their best to heal the
wounds of their people. Their reign was one of peace
and of reconstruction. The sovereign power was even
stronger than before the crisis of the sixteenth century.
No revolt troubled the happy years of the Archduke’s
rule. National institutions were not disturbed, the
re-establishment of order was attempted by law rather
than by force. In 1611 a meeting of magistrates and
lawyers was called in order to codify the judicial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
provisions and to inaugurate a reform of civil and criminal
law. The fruit of that attempt was the <i>Édit perpétuel</i>, a
judicial monument of great importance. At the same
time the old customs, the unwritten law of the Belgian
principalities and cities, were reduced to writing and
published in definite form by order of the sovereign.</p>

<p>In addition to the respect they manifested for the customs
of the country, Albert and Isabella showed the utmost
interest in the restoration of every kind of social activity.
Zealous for the welfare of Catholicism, they undertook
to restore the religious life of the country. Three hundred
churches and convents were rebuilt or founded. The
religious orders of the Jesuits, the Carmelites, etc., found
in the sovereigns hearty and generous protectors. The
lost treasures of the churches had to be replaced, and
the restoration of worship brought about the revival of
the goldsmith’s art and of painting. The Flemish school
of painting again became as famous as in the time of the
Burgundian dukes. The head of this school was Peter
Paul Rubens; and among his pupils he counted artists
like Van Dyck, Teniers, and Jordaens. Public education
was encouraged and many colleges and academies were
opened for the teaching of Greek and Latin. The University
of Louvain was accorded special protection.
In 1607 Drusius, abbot of the abbey of Parc, near Louvain,
and Van Craesbeke, councilor of Brabant, were appointed
to inspect the University. Another delegate, the Nuncio
Caraffa, was sent by the Pope. The system of “visitation,”
as it was called, lasted, with interruptions, till
1617, when a complete scheme of regulations was enacted.
The jurisdiction of the academic authorities, the privileges
of the University, the interests of teaching and of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
various colleges, the rights and duties of professors,
the granting of degrees, the discipline and conduct of
the students—everything was carefully dealt with. The
visitation of 1617 established the authority of the University
of Louvain and gave it a legal status.</p>

<p>The excellent results of the new rules were immediately
apparent. At this time seven or eight thousand students,
among them Dutchmen, Frisians, Flemings, Germans,
Frenchmen, Spaniards, and Italians, were in attendance
at the University. The faculty of law became especially
notable, and professors such as Peckius, Coursèle, Tulden,
Perez, and Gudelin were regarded as eminent authorities.
In letters the humanists Justus Lipsius and Erycius
Puteanus, Valerius Andreas and Nicholas Vernuleus were
famous. Albert and Isabella showed clearly their lively
interest in the institution by attending one of the lectures
of Justus Lipsius.</p>

<p>Although artistic, literary, and scientific interests
flourished during the reign of Albert and Isabella, the trade
and industry of Belgium enjoyed no such revival. Antwerp
was closed and had no access to the sea, as the Dutch
blocked the Scheldt, and all commerce with the colonies
of the New World was forbidden to the people of Belgium
by Spain. Moreover, the peace and safety necessary to
the development of trade were continually threatened by
France in the south and by the United Provinces in the
north.</p>

<p>The private life of Albert and Isabelle was modest
and simple. Their court at Brussels was an example of
morality and seriousness, although they were not given
over to bigotry. Isabella was a cheerful princess; she
liked to mingle sometimes with the people and to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
part in their rejoicings and their sports. Both sovereigns
were very popular.</p>

<p>Sorrow filled the souls of the Belgians when the Archduke
died in 1621, without issue. According to the testament
of Philip II, Belgium was held obliged to return to
Spanish rule. Indeed, Spain immediately took possession
of the country and, although Isabella remained at Brussels,
she was no longer a sovereign, but a simple regent in the
name of the King. When she died in 1633, the universal
mourning in town and country proved how well she had
succeeded in winning the sympathy of the Belgians.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p class="center">THE LAST YEARS OF THE SPANISH RULE (1633-1715)</p>

<p>The last eighty years of the seventeenth century were
an unhappy period for Belgium. France, under Richelieu
and Louis XIV, continually attacked the declining Spanish
monarchy, and sought to wrest from it the Belgian
provinces piece by piece. From 1622 to 1648 France was
assisted in this policy of conquest by the United Provinces
of Holland. Each treaty of this period marks a territorial
diminution of Belgium and sometimes likewise a decisive
blow at the elements of its material prosperity. The
Treaty of Munster, concluded in 1648 between Spain and
the United Provinces, remorselessly sacrificed the commercial
interests of Belgium. According to this treaty
it was agreed that the Dutch should have the right to
control and to close the Scheldt, the very source of Antwerp’s
wealth. It was also agreed that henceforth the
United Provinces should definitely retain their independence,
won by William the Silent and his sons, should even
remain in possession of Northern Brabant and Northern
Flanders, and should divide with Belgium the sovereignty
over Maestricht.</p>

<p>The act which established the final separation between
Belgium and Holland constituted also the first act of
hostility of the latter. As a consequence of the Treaty
of Munster, Limburg was divided between both countries
in 1661. The Dutch obtained the larger part of the
country of Fauquemont and Daelhem and a portion of
Rolduc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span></p>

<p>Other territorial losses were forced upon Belgium some
years later. In 1659, France acquired nearly all the
country of Artois, by the Treaty of the Pyrennees; in
1668, French Flanders and Tournaisis, by the Treaty of
Aix-la-Chapelle; in 1678, Franche-Comté, Cambrai and
Cambrésis, and the rest of Artois, by the Treaty of
Nimègue. On the whole, the defeats suffered by the
Spanish monarchy at the period of its decline cost Belgium,
hopelessly attached to the dying body, the north of
Flanders, and the south of Flanders, of Hainaut, and of
Luxemburg.</p>

<p>Each treaty terminated a war; and from the numerous
negotiations already mentioned it is not difficult to realize
how many wars Belgium was forced to endure on her own
soil. Dutch, French, English, Spanish, Germans, successively
trampled over the rich fields of Flanders and
the industrious country of the Walloons. In fifty years,
from 1642 to 1709, no less than ten famous battles were
fought on Belgian soil. Belgium was already at that time
“the cockpit of Christendom,” a designation found in an
old English book, <i>Instructions for Forreine Travell</i>; written
in 1642 by James Howell, a clerk in the diplomatic service.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Howell says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... For the Netherlands have been for many years, as
one may say, the very cockpit of Christendom, the school of
arms and rendezvous of all adventurous spirits and cadets;
which makes most nations beholden to them for soldiers. Therefore
the history of the Belgic wars are very worth the reading;
for I know none fuller of stratagems, of reaches of policy, ...
nor a war which hath produced such deplorable effects, directly
or collaterally, all Christendom over, both by sea and land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span></p>

<p>What all these wars meant for the poor inhabitants of
the country may be imagined when the devastation
wrought by huge armies in Poland today is borne in
mind. And it must be remembered that the armies of
the belligerent powers in the seventeenth century were,
to a large extent, composed of mercenaries without any
feeling of patriotism, without discipline, without morals,
who saw in military occupation only an opportunity for
excesses and outrages of all kinds, who revolted when not
regularly paid, and who pillaged the friendly country
they were hired to defend as well as the enemy’s territory.
Massacre, burning, looting, awful tortures inflicted on the
unhappy inhabitants in order to force them to reveal the
spot where their money was kept—all this was daily work
for those rough hirelings. In the village of Meix-devant-Virton,
in 1636, the whole populace was burned alive
in the church where it had taken refuge, not by the
enemy, but by the Spanish troops intrusted with their
defense.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Ruin, disease, and poverty were the terrible
lot of Belgium during this sinister century.</p>

<p>What of the internal situation of the country? After
the death of Archduke Albert (1621), the Spaniards
increasingly dominated the destinies of Belgium. A
Spanish army, paid by Spain and under a Spanish commander,
permanently occupied many fortresses and important
cities. Those members of the Belgian aristocracy
who sought to obtain influence with the intruders found
themselves compelled to marry their daughters to
Spaniards. The Spanish government put the native nobles
entirely aside, and all important matters were discussed
in <i>Juntas</i>—special committees composed of Spaniards.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span></p>
<p>This unhappy state of things in 1622-33 provoked the
so-called “conspiracy of the Belgian nobility against
Spain.” This was the work of some prominent <i>seigneurs</i>
who failed to realize the historical conditions and the
times in which they lived. They fondly believed that,
with the help of France and of the United Provinces,
they could start another Belgian revolt, like that of the
sixteenth century, and that they could obtain support
from the army and the people. They found themselves
seriously mistaken. The Belgians, wearied of their
misfortunes, refused to follow them. They had no confidence
in the movement. The attempt failed and the
conspirators were obliged to flee to foreign countries to
avoid criminal prosecution. As for the States-General,
except in 1600 and 1632-34, they were never called
together; only when there was talk of peace negotiations
with the United Provinces were they allowed to meet.</p>

<p>The rule of the Hapsburg dynasty in Spain came to an
end with the death of the last heir, Charles II, in 1700.
The latter had provided in his will that Philip of Bourbon,
grandson of Louis XIV, of France, should be his successor
and consequently sovereign of the Netherlands. As a
matter of fact, it was Louis XIV who governed in the name
of Philip. The absolutist system which existed in France
was suddenly introduced in Belgium, and organized by
the Count of Bergeyck, with the help of French generals.
This régime did not last long; in 1702 the War of the
Spanish Succession broke out, in the course of which
England and the United Provinces concluded an alliance
against Louis XIV.</p>

<p>Three treaties terminated the struggle—that of
Utrecht, that of Rastadt, and that of Bade (1713-14).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
The contracting powers decided that the Netherlands—that
is to say, Belgium—should be transferred to the Austrian
branch of the Hapsburgs. They would serve as a
barrier for the protection of the United Provinces against
any menace from France, and it was determined, therefore,
that the Dutch should continue to occupy Belgian
territory provisionally till all questions had been settled.
A final agreement was reached by the Treaty of Antwerp,
better known as the “Treaty of the Barriers” (1715),
somewhat modified by the Hague Convention of 1718.
These several conventions placed the Hapsburgs of Austria
in full possession of Belgium.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">BELGIUM UNDER THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA
(1713-89)</p>

<p>When the house of Austria came into possession of
Belgium only ten provinces out of the seventeen of the
old Spanish Netherlands were left: Brabant, Limburg,
Luxemburg, Namur, Hainaut, the seigniory of Tournai,
the seigniory of Tournaisis, Flanders, the seigniory of
Malines, a part of Gueldre. West Flanders, including
Ypres and some adjoining districts, formed a separate
department.</p>

<p>The Hapsburgs of Austria were not to be regarded as foreign
conquerors of Belgium. From the outset they had
claimed to be the natural heirs of the Hapsburgs of Spain,
and that claim was admitted by France, England, and Holland,
and by the States-General of the Belgian provinces.
There could be no question of Austrian “domination.”
In their relation to Belgium the Hapsburgs assumed the
title of natural prince, as did Charles V at the beginning
of the sixteenth century. Moreover, by the Treaty of the
Barriers, Charles VI of Austria publicly proclaimed that
his house assumed the rule over Belgium, subject to all the
restrictions and guaranties to which the Hapsburgs of
Spain had been subject. According to the treaties, Belgium
was ceded to the Austrian Hapsburgs on condition
that the predominance of the Catholic church in the
country as well as the rights of the states and cities be
recognized. The Catholic church and its position as the
religion of the state were to be respected on account of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
the desire of France to erect a moral and religious barrier
between herself and Protestant Holland; the popular
rights were to be respected because the theory of the
European balance of power required that the Emperor
should be permitted only a limited sway. A strong,
universal monarchy was no longer possible in Europe.</p>

<p>The theory of the European balance of power had
found expression through the Treaty of Westphalia
(1648), whereby Europe ceased to be exclusively and
officially Catholic, and Protestantism was granted recognition
in law. Since the arbitration of the Pope in international
matters was no longer possible, owing to the
refusal of the Protestant powers to acknowledge his
decisions, each country had to rely only upon itself. The
weaker states had only one protection, therefore, namely,
to unite against any power which might try to absorb
them. Out of these principles grew the idea of the European
balance of power, according to which no state was
to be allowed to grow strong enough to menace the peace
of the world.</p>

<p>The external constitution of Belgium under Austrian
rule having been established, Charles VI proceeded to protect
the rights of his family in respect to internal conditions.
As Charles V had established the principle of
the indivisibility of the Spanish Netherlands by the
Augsburg transaction, already mentioned, the new Emperor
established the same principle for the “Austrian Netherlands”
by a similar act, the “Pragmatic Sanction” of
1725. Belgium was forever to be kept as an indivisible
whole, the eldest son to be heir to the throne, and the
right of succession of the female descendants in case
of the failure of a male heir was again admitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span></p>

<p>Well-defined obligations to the United Provinces of
Holland were imposed upon Belgium by the Treaty of
the Barriers. The Belgian sovereign was required to permit
the presence of Dutch garrisons on Belgian soil, as
a protection for Holland against France, in the cities and
fortresses of Namur, Tournai, Furnes, Warneton, Ypres,
and Knocke. A heavy yearly subsidy was to be paid by
Belgium for the maintenance of those garrisons. The
sovereign was also required to recognize the closing of the
Scheldt, imposed by the Treaty of Munster (1648).
Holland even claimed the right to prevent the Belgians
from trading with the Indies.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these claims, Charles VI had tried
to restore Belgian trade by the foundation of a shipping
company, the “Compagnie d’Ostende,” created under an
imperial charter, for commercial dealings with America.
But the opposition offered by Holland, supported by
France and England, so influenced the weak Emperor as
to induce him to suspend and finally to disband the company—the
only hope for the restoration of national trade.</p>

<p>The obligation to maintain foreign garrisons in Belgium
was both drastic and humiliating. Empress Maria Theresa,
who succeeded Charles VI as the sovereign of the
Austrian Netherlands in virtue of the provision of the
“Pragmatic Sanction,” tried to avoid the obligation of
the “Barrier” by withholding payment due to the foreign
garrisons. The final blow to this unjust system was
given by her son, Emperor Joseph II, who simply ordered
the demolition of the fortresses still occupied by the
Dutch on Belgian soil.</p>

<p>Joseph II, who was greatly interested in the restoration
of the prosperity of the country, even attempted to secure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
the complete opening of the Scheldt, still closed by the
Dutch. After diplomatic negotiations, begun in 1784,
had failed, owing to the energetic opposition of the United
Provinces, once more supported by France, the Emperor
tried to settle the question in a practical but simple manner.
He ordered a vessel to leave Antwerp and follow the
course of the river down to the sea, and another vessel to
start from Ostend and follow the course of the river up
to Antwerp. The Dutch, he hoped, would not fire upon
the vessels, and the Scheldt would be opened to shipping
by this stratagem. But the Dutch did fire, and forced
the Belgian vessels to withdraw. Any further move on
the part of the Emperor would mean war, and for this
Joseph II was not prepared. The Scheldt remained closed.</p>

<p>What was the policy of the Austrian Hapsburgs toward
the institutions of the country? It was essentially
Austrian, and tended toward absolutism, influenced
nevertheless by the teachings of the French philosophical
school. It aimed at the diminution of the liberty of the
clergy and the recognition of the state as superior to the
church; at strengthening the sovereign power, overriding
the national institutions and the ancient and well-established
privileges; at conferring political initiative
on the Austrian governor-general of Belgium; at depriving
the Belgian nobility of any participation in political
affairs; at recruiting public officers from among the
jurists only; at avoiding any brutal attack upon the
national institutions, but at undermining them in a
secret manner. It cannot be denied, however, that the
Austrian government did its best to restore the material
welfare of the country; and the manufacturing and
agricultural interests were fostered by two Austrian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
ministers, both of Italian nationality, Antoniotto di Botta
Adorno, under Maria Theresa, and Count Giovanni
Giacomo di Belgiojoso, during the reign of Joseph II.</p>

<p>This Emperor had a sincere desire to promote the
material welfare of the Belgian people, and it is a historical
fact that at the beginning of his reign he visited
Belgium incognito, accompanied by one of his ministers,
in order to examine into everything himself and to take
such measures as he might find to be necessary. Unfortunately
he was somewhat of an idealist, imbued with the
theories of the French philosophy of the eighteenth
century and the teachings of “Febronianism.”</p>

<p>France was at this time the center of an intellectual
and moral current, which exerted a powerful influence on
the courts and the higher classes of all Europe. The social,
philosophical, economical, and governmental doctrines
of the Encyclopaedists and the Physiocrats attacked the
basis of the existing society. They proposed the creation
of an entirely new social and political order, breaking with
tradition, and conceived of as independent of any Christian
idea. On the other hand, the doctrines of the superiority
of the state over the church were already promulgated,
since Van Espen, a Belgian jurist of the seventeenth
century, had supported them. They were codified in
1763 by Febronius, the suffragan bishop of Treves, who
developed them to the extreme limit. He proposed
breaking up the Catholic church into national churches,
under the supervision of the state. His book had an
immense success at the German courts, even those of the
ecclesiastical principalities.</p>

<p>Joseph II had been converted to the ideas of the
French Encyclopaedists and Physiocrats as well as to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
teachings of Febronianism. An absolutist by conviction,
an enemy of the liberties of the church, despising all
things of the past, and lacking in the adroitness which
characterized Maria Theresa’s government, he sought to
put in force without delay the new concept of human
society that he had conceived. He tried to force upon
Belgium a whole series of reforms, by means of sovereign
decrees, between the years 1781 and 1787. The fundamental
ideas at the basis of these reforms may be summarized
as follows: the secularization of political society;
the incorporation of the Catholic church in Belgium as a
part of the national Austrian church; and the recognition
of the sovereign power as absolute and unlimited.</p>

<p>The political secularization of Belgium was attempted
by the Edicts of Tolerance, issued in 1781-82. The
ecclesiastical jurisdiction was suppressed; non-Catholics
were put upon nearly the same level as Catholics, and
public worship was permitted to them under certain
restrictions. Subject to a dispensation from the sovereign,
they were admitted to public offices and could
become burgesses and members of craft-guilds. In 1784
another edict fixed new rules for marriages, and prevented
the ecclesiastical judge from dealing with the canonical
impediments declared by canon law.</p>

<p>As for the subordination of the church to the state, the
religious orders were no longer allowed to show obedience
to their foreign superiors; the jurisdiction of the Nuncio
of Cologne over Belgium was abolished; the Belgian
bishops were forbidden to correspond with Rome on the
matter of dispensations for marriages; a large number of
convents were declared to be useless and were suppressed,
their properties being placed under the administration of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
the state; parishes were delimited by the government; all
the confraternities of a religious nature were suppressed
and replaced by a single one, which the Emperor-Philosopher
called the “Brotherhood of Love for Fellow-Creatures.”
All the seminaries for the education of
priests were closed, and in 1786 a General Seminary was
established at Louvain and in Luxemburg, at which
theology was to be taught, subject to the control of the
state. A very drastic measure was the suppression of any
subsidy to the society of the Bollandists, the Belgian
Jesuits who were responsible for the criticism and the
publication of the Lives of the Saints, and who were known
all over Europe for their scientific methods and their
superior culture.</p>

<p>In 1787 came the upheaval of the political institutions.
The three “collateral councils”—the Council of State,
the Privy Council, and the Council of Finances—were
abolished. The Secretary of State, the provincial states,
the provincial councils of justice, the seigniorial or manorial
justice, the jurisdiction of the <i>échevinage</i>, the ecclesiastical
tribunals, the special tribunal of the University of Louvain
which had jurisdiction over offenses committed by students,
and all other courts of justice except the military
tribunals, were at one stroke suppressed. Joseph II, by a
simple act of his sovereign will, wiped out the old institutions
and introduced the Austrian autocracy.</p>

<p>But the Belgians, who had always fought against the
enemies of their institutions and privileges, did not submit
peacefully to this brutal attack upon their liberties. Of
course, many of the reforms of the Emperor were not open
to criticism, and his motives cannot be said to have been
wholly wrong. His efforts, however, were too general in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
their nature, and were attended with too far-reaching
results. At first there was only passive resistance. The
bishops had begun by protesting against the religious
reforms. The general edicts of 1787 called forth a storm
of revolt among all classes of the people. Declarations,
petitions, manifestos poured in upon the Emperor’s
court. The edicts of 1787 were thereupon partly suspended.
But the religious reforms were not abated.
The establishment of the General Seminary and the order
for the closing of the diocesan seminaries were not
rescinded, and force was resorted to against the Archbishop
of Malines, Frankenberg, and the University of
Louvain in carrying them out. This shocked the Belgian
people, who at heart were Catholic, and the harsh measures
of the Austrian General D’Alton made the situation
still more critical. Two parties came into existence:
that of the nationalists, called “Patriots,” and that of
the Austrian sympathizers, called by the people “Figs.”
In 1788, owing to the resistance of the states of Brabant
and Hainaut, the arrest of their members and the abolition
of the privileges of Brabant, among them the famous
“Joyeuse Entrée,” were ordered. General D’Alton became
more and more dictatorial and cruel. The result
was a serious revolution, known in history as the Brabantine
Revolution (1789).</p>

<p>The revolt was the consequence of two elements among
the people, which though at heart directly opposed to each
other were temporarily united against the foreign tyranny.
Each movement had its own leader, Van der Noot and
Vonck, and both were lawyers of Brabant. Van der Noot
proposed to deliver Belgium by the assistance of foreign
powers, especially Prussia—the enemy of Austria—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
Holland. Vonck, on the other hand, placed his confidence
in the Belgians alone, and told the people that the great
powers would betray them. Both were forced to flee
the country in order to escape the anger of General
D’Alton. Both established committees for revolutionary
propaganda, Van der Noot in Holland, where he established
connections in Prussia; Vonck in the territory of
the principality of Liège. Later both committees succeeded
in agreeing upon a common plan of action. Like
William the Silent in the sixteenth century, Van der Noot
issued a manifesto proclaiming the deposition of Joseph II
as sovereign of the Austrian Netherlands. A national
army, recruited on foreign soil, invaded Belgium. The
Austrians were defeated and compelled to evacuate the
country, except Luxemburg, where they made a stand.
The victors then proclaimed a republic, known in history
under the official title of the “République des États
Belgiques unis” (Republic of the United States of
Belgium). In each province the body of the states—delegates
of the clergy, the nobility, and the people—were
given the exercise of sovereignty, and the traditional
institutions of the Burgundian times were restored. In
1790 the provinces held a general meeting at Brussels,
where the federal pact between them and the central
power was established by the so-called Act of Union.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp49" id="i_b_138fp" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_138fp.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">THE TOWN HALL OF BRUSSELS AND THE GREAT SQUARE</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>According to this act, the provinces of the Catholic
Netherlands constituted themselves a confederation,
under that name. The confederation exercised sovereign
power, and controlled the common defense, the power of
making war and peace, the recruiting and maintaining
of a national army, the making of alliances, the coinage of
a common currency. The power residing in the confederation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>was exercised by a Congress composed of deputies
from all the provinces, who acted without referring back
to the provincial states. Each province had a certain
number of votes in the Congress: Brabant 20 votes,
Flanders 22, etc. The confederated provinces made a
declaration favoring the Roman Catholic faith and the
maintenance of relations with the church as before the
reforms of Joseph II. Each province retained its autonomy
and sovereign rights, and all powers not delegated
to the Congress. In case of attack all provinces were
to join in the defense of the one attacked. This, we
know, had been the dream of Emperor Charles V in the
sixteenth century. The great ruler must have rejoiced
in his grave! The Congress was presided over by a
president, who held office for a limited period, and three
committees were created within the Congress: one for
political, one for military, and one for financial affairs.
The president was assisted by a prime minister and a
secretary of state.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to call attention to the fact that
there is a very close resemblance between the constitution
of the Belgian Republic and the first constitution of
the American Republic, whose articles were approved
in 1777. The question whether the Belgian Patriots were
in any way inspired by the first American constitution
remains unsettled, as it has not yet been studied in
this light.</p>

<p>Alas! the “République des États Belgiques unis” did
not live long. Internal struggles between partisans of
Vonck, who fell more and more under the influence of
the French revolutionary clubs and talked much about
national assemblies and popular sovereignty, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
partisans of the more conservative Van der Noot paved
the way for the final collapse. But the bitterest disappointment
came from outside. The great powers—England,
Holland, and Prussia—which had liberally
encouraged the Patriots in their revolt because of its
tendency to weaken Austria and to prevent her policy of
extension in the east of Europe toward Constantinople,
betrayed the young republic. Their support of the Belgian
claims had been inspired by the idea of the European
balance of power, but they cared little for the
independence of the country. The conference held at
Reichenbach, in which England, Prussia, Holland, and
Austria participated merely resulted in a decision to
restore Austrian rule in Belgium, with guaranties for the
maintenance of the ancient institutions and an amnesty
for the past. The Treaty of the Hague (1790) definitely
settled the question. Thus died the Belgian republic
after a year of existence, but it had not existed in vain.
The Treaty of the Hague gave constitutional value to
facts and principles which hitherto had depended only
on the good will of the sovereign. Emperor Leopold II
again occupied the “Austrian Netherlands”; but the
new Austrian rule was to have as short an existence as
had the Belgian republic. The French Revolution was
destined to drive the Austrians out of Belgium.</p>

<p class="center">BELGIUM UNDER FRENCH DOMINATION

(1792-1814)</p>

<p>The French revolutionary clubs had exerted a powerful
influence on Vonck. The effect of their teachings
had also been felt in the independent principality of
Liège and had provoked a rising of the people against the
bishop-prince. But the revolt of Liège, which occurred
at the same time as the revolt in Belgium against Joseph II
(1789), was quickly suppressed.</p>

<p>When France itself fell a victim to the revolutionary
leaders, the great Revolution broke loose. The French
soon found themselves confronted by a European coalition
and were forced into war. Since Austria was inimical to
the Revolution, the French troops invaded the Belgian
possessions of the Hapsburgs in 1792 under the leadership
of General Dumouriez. They found not a few
sympathizers in the country. The partisans of Van der
Noot looked to the French to deliver them from the
Austrian yoke; the partisans of Vonck had always been
agents of the French revolutionary leaders, and desired the
annexation of their country to France. After the victory
of Jemappes (1792), the French entered Belgium, loudly
proclaiming that they came as liberators of the people and
desired only the destruction of Austrian tyranny. Although
the excesses of their troops seemed to contradict
this statement, the people believed them. Then came the
second and final defeat of the Austrians at the battle of
Fleurus (1794). Both Belgium and the principality of
Liège were occupied by the victors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span></p>

<p>A period of terrible excesses followed. The French
National Convention entirely abolished all the ancient
institutions; a provisional administration was established,
and “clubs” with political aims were introduced into all
the cities. Taxes, requisitions, systematic pillage, outrages
on religious convictions rained upon the unhappy
inhabitants. General elections were forced upon the
Belgians and manipulated by the “Sans-culottes” and
political agents so as to give the impression of a referendum,
through which the people should express their
desire to be annexed to France. This plan encountered
general hostility throughout the country. Thereupon the
National Convention, by a law voted and applied on
October 1, 1795, simply annexed Belgium and the principality
of Liège. As Austria was too weak to defend her
possessions, it formally ceded the Austrian Netherlands
to France and recognized the annexation by the Treaty of
Campo Formio (1797).</p>

<p>The French now treated the conquered territory with
great harshness. The followers of the Catholic religion
were severely persecuted, the churches were closed, the
priests were sentenced to death or deported to French
Guiana and to the islands of Ré and Oléron, the Catholic
worship was suppressed and replaced by that of the
“Goddess of Reason.” For the first time in Belgian
history military conscription was forced upon the inhabitants,
and the youth of the country was compelled to
shed its blood on foreign battlefields for a régime it
abhorred.</p>

<p>This naturally stirred up bitter resentment; and, even
as they had risen against Joseph II, so a part at least of the
Belgians rose against the French. This revolt is known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
as the War of the Peasants (1798-99), because it was
mainly the people of the countryside in Flanders, Campine,
and Luxemburg who fought in defense of their hearths and
their religion. They fought heroically with old weapons,
scythes, pikes, and guns of old pattern, under the leadership
of a few nobles and burgesses. There is a close
resemblance between their struggle and that of the French
peasants in the Vendée. But what could they accomplish
against the well-equipped armies of the Republic? The
egotism of the educated classes, which gave them no support
at all, and their lack of training and experience, soon
brought their valiant resistance to an inglorious end.
One after another their bands were exterminated, and
those who did not fall on the battlefield died against a wall
by the bullets of a firing squad.</p>

<p>Their gallantry did not save the country. Belgium
remained fifteen years longer under French domination.
The Concordat concluded in 1801 between Pope Pius VII
and Napoleon Bonaparte brought the religious persecution
to an end, and the Catholic worship was restored.
When Bonaparte had become Emperor Napoleon I, the
glory which surrounded his name made a profound
impression on the Belgians, and the great Emperor became
very popular among them. Antwerp attracted all his
attention; and it is due to him that the Scheldt, after a
century and a half of being closed, was again opened to
trade and was freed from the tyrannous control of the
Dutch. As military conscription still prevailed, the
Belgians filled the ranks of the imperial army, and their
blood was shed for the fame and the power of Napoleon
all over Europe. The conqueror left on the country,
however, the impress of his spirit of organization in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
famous <i>Code Napoléon</i>, that monument of civil law that
still forms the basis of Belgian jurisprudence. The spell
of his name appeared from the fact that after the defeat
of his armies at Leipzig in 1813 there was no revolt against
him in Belgium as there was in Holland.</p>

<p>The fall of Napoleon ended the French domination of
the Belgians (1814). However, the diplomats who rearranged
the map of Europe, while the once mighty
Emperor was sent to St. Helena, had determined that
the country was not to be restored to its former political
status.</p>

<p class="center">THE DUTCH RULE AND THE BELGIAN REVOLT
OF 1830</p>

<p>After the fall of Napoleon, the powers were called
upon to decide the political status of Belgium. The
Belgians were not consulted in the matter, vitally important
as it was, and their country was considered merely
as the spoil of the Allies. The main idea that actuated
the Congress of Vienna (1814-15) in rearranging the map
of Europe was to prevent a new menace from the side of
France. This country was not allowed to hold more
territory than it possessed in 1789, before the outbreak
of the Revolution; at the same time the Allies who had
defeated Napoleon sought to erect a bulwark against
any new extension of France in the North. They could
have granted independence to Belgium, but as the country
was weak it seemed that independence would mean
reabsorption by France. The final settlement of this
important question resulted, therefore, in the formation
of the new Kingdom of the Netherlands, whereby both
Belgium and Holland, united under the same sovereign,
would, it was expected, present a sufficiently strong
barrier against France. The new kingdom was declared
also to be neutral territory. This is the first time that
the conception of neutrality was realized with regard to
a buffer-state in Western Europe, located between England,
France, and Germany. But the conception of
neutrality, as applied to the Netherlands, is much older
than the Congress of Vienna; and it seems worth while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
to trace the different schemes dealing with Belgian neutrality
before the years 1814-15.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The idea of establishing the neutrality of the Netherlands
goes back in history as far as the government of
Maria of Hungary, at the time of Emperor Charles V.
The former proposed the neutrality of the Belgian provinces
on February 8, 1536, in order that they might
escape being made the battlefield of Europe during the
impending international conflicts. Charles V refused
to consider the scheme, as he himself was planning to
raise the Netherlands into an independent kingdom, to
be governed by the son of Francis I, King of France.
This plan, of course, was never carried out.</p>

<p>In 1634 France and Holland concluded a special treaty
against Spain, by which the Netherlands should either
become an independent kingdom or be divided between
the contracting powers. Cardinal Richelieu, the French
minister, preferred the idea of an independent Belgium,
and went so far as to propose that this kingdom should
be permanently neutral. In that way the cornerstone
of Spanish power in Europe would have been destroyed.
Although neutral, Belgium would have had the right to
conclude offensive alliances, but would not enjoy the
benefit of having the integrity of its territory guaranteed.
If that scheme had been carried out, the Belgians would
have had to revolt against Spanish rule. But the Belgians,
owing to the presence of strong Spanish armies
within their borders, did not revolt. The plan of Richelieu
failed. His scheme was, however, taken over by
Cardinal Mazarin, minister of Louis XIV. Mazarin had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>first suggested the annexation of Belgium by France, but
he met with strong opposition on the part of Holland and
England, both interested in keeping the French menace
from extending right to their own doors. Changing
his mind, Mazarin, in 1658, reverted to Richelieu’s plan
concerning the creation of an independent and neutral
Belgium. This proposal met with the strong opposition
of the Dutch “Staatspensionnaris” De Witt, who
expressed the fear that such a state would ruin Dutch
trade—an independent Belgium would necessarily be
given a free Scheldt. He also made it clear that Holland
could not forego her right to meddle in the affairs of the
Catholic Netherlands, and that the idea of a common
protectorate over them would be welcome. Mazarin
seems not to have been sincere when proposing his plan.
It may be inferred that his main object was to quiet the
fear of Holland that the French and the English would
use Belgium as a base during their operations against
Spain.</p>

<p>When the Treaty of the Barriers (1715) threatened to
impose upon Belgium the Dutch garrisons which were
maintained for protection against France, the latter
presented (February 17) a memoir to Holland, again
proposing the status of permanent neutrality for Belgium.
The egotism and ill-will of the Dutch defeated this proposal.
They would never have consented to the opening
of the Scheldt, which was a necessary condition for an
independent Belgium. Their policy on this point is made
clear by the declaration of the States-General of the
United Provinces, when Emperor Joseph II, in 1756,
endeavored to obtain the opening of the Scheldt and free
shipping on the river. The States-General declared that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
“the salvation or the loss of the Republic and its inhabitants
depended upon this point.”</p>

<p>When the Revolution of the Belgians against Austrian
rule broke out in 1789, the Elector Frederick-William of
Prussia tried in vain to obtain from the other powers,
England and Holland, the recognition of the Belgian
Republic. He proposed that they should recognize the
independence of Belgium and compel the Belgians “to
establish a firm, strong constitution, in conformity with
the interests of the Allies...; to create, subject to
the advice of the Allies, a respectable military state that
would inspire confidence; to avoid alliances with powers,
enemies of the Allies, and also trade with them.”</p>

<p>As Prussia was ready to make war on Austria, her
hereditary enemy, Emperor Leopold II declared that he
would, in case of war, cede the “Austrian Netherlands”
to France. This England could not have permitted, and
therefore that country withdrew support from Prussia,
causing the Elector Frederick-William to abandon his
plan concerning Belgium.</p>

<p>The French conquest of Belgium entirely changed the
policy of the European powers with regard to the Belgian
problem. England now saw the French menace facing
her own shores, and, according to her traditional policy,
began to take measures to avoid the danger. On November
13, 1813, Lord Castlereagh wrote to the English
ambassador in Vienna: “I must particularly recommend
you to pay attention to Antwerp.... Leaving Antwerp
in the hands of France means, or almost means,
imposing on us the necessity of a continuous state of war.”
It was now England that was specially interested in the
future status of Belgium, and it is from that country that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
emanated the idea, forcibly expressed, of establishing
a strong bulwark against France by the creation of the
neutral kingdom of the Netherlands. The idea, supported
by Prussia, which, as we have seen, had advocated it
some years before, was, however, this time expressed by
Lord Castlereagh; and the aggrandizement of Holland
by its union with Belgium was strongly supported by the
Duke of Wellington. Accordingly, on July 31, 1814,
the Belgian provinces were formally handed over to the
Prince of Orange, whom the Dutch had made their
sovereign the year before. The arrangement was confirmed
by the Congress of Vienna, and made to include
Liège and Luxemburg.</p>

<p>The union of Belgium and Holland was the work of
diplomacy: the Belgians had not even been consulted.
It was an essentially bad combination. Had the “complete
and intimate fusion,” of which the diplomats spoke,
been possible between both countries, the projectors
would have accomplished an admirable work, offering
the surest guaranties for the maintenance of European
peace and the durability of their own fabric. But
unfortunately the conception was utopian.</p>

<p>Independently of the fact that the Allies disdained to
consult the feelings of the Belgian people, they appeared to
have lost sight of the moral history of the Netherlands, and
to have forgotten those deep-rooted hatreds, jealousies,
and dissensions, both religious and political, that had
divided the two peoples since the time of their separation
in the sixteenth century. Count Charles Van Hoogendorp,
a prominent member of the Dutch chamber, in a
pamphlet entitled <i>Séparation de la Hollande et de la Belgique</i>,
October, 1830 (Amsterdam), himself acknowledged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
the lack of sympathy between these peoples: “The difference
of national character had engendered grievances,
and these grievances had excited universal discontent,
and national animosity. The division between the two
countries existed <i>de facto</i>. Instead of a fusion, all the
means employed to amalgamate the two people had only
served to disunite them still further. This discontent
was not the birth of a day; it dates from the first union
of the two states.”</p>

<p>After peace had been restored in 1815, when Napoleon
had suffered defeat at Waterloo, difficulties began at
once. In March, 1814, Holland had adopted a constitution.
Inspired by the old laws of the United Provinces,
it was in the main strongly Protestant. Eleven Dutch,
eleven Belgians, and two delegates representing Luxemburg
were appointed to transform this constitution into
one that could be applied to the new kingdom of the
Netherlands. The commission proposed the introduction
of equality and toleration for all creeds throughout
the kingdom, and the creation of a two-chambered Parliament
in which Holland and Belgium were to have an
equal number of representatives, although the Belgians
had 50 per cent more population. No national capital
was specified, but the King was to be invested both
at Amsterdam and at some city in Belgium. On these
principles a fundamental constitution was drafted and submitted
contemporaneously to the Dutch States-General
and to the notables of the different Belgian provinces. The
Dutch passed it unanimously; the Belgians rejected it by
a vote of 1,603 to 527. This rejection was partly due to
the unwillingness of the Belgian notables to legalize religious
equality. The Dutch King, William I, decided to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
meet the difficulty in a simple manner. He announced
that all who had abstained from voting should be counted
as voting for the act, and that the 126 hostile votes still
remaining as a majority against the act after counting in
its favor those refraining from voting should not count,
as the principle of religious liberty had been imposed by
the Congress of Vienna and had to be observed. This
method, which the Belgians called “Dutch arithmetic,”
gave to the act 933 votes in its favor as against 670
hostile votes, and it was declared passed.</p>

<p>It became more and more clear that William I was not
“the right man in the right place”: he was too Protestant,
too Dutch, too autocratic for the Belgians. The
latter soon complained of new grievances, among which
the following were the most important: the imposition of
the Dutch language upon all functionaries, whether civil
or military, without granting time to learn it to those who
could not speak it; the extreme partiality shown in the
distribution of all offices and emoluments; and a financial
system that bore heavily and unjustly on Belgium. The
Belgians were made to contribute to the payment of
debts incurred by Holland long prior to the union, and
to pay for the defense of the Dutch colonies, which yielded
them no returns at all. The Haute Cour, or supreme
court of justice, and all other great public institutions
were established in Holland. The religious grievances
were also numerous: the government was ill disposed
toward the Catholics, and it was supposed that it desired
to “Protestantize” the people. Since 1815, the Belgian
bishops, under the leadership of Monsignor de Broglie,
bishop of Ghent, had dissuaded their flocks from taking
the oath to a constitution that introduced liberty of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
worship. Moreover, in 1825, William I, imitating the
plan formerly developed by Joseph II, had established
a Philosophic College at Louvain where all priests would
receive their education; and, claiming the monopoly for
the state in educational matters, had suppressed the
episcopal and other national colleges and free schools.
Sundry oppressive taxes, repugnant to the habits and
usages of the people, were imposed. The freedom of the
press was destroyed, and journalists were continually
prosecuted before the tribunals. The King even pressed
into service ignominious French pamphleteers, expelled
from their own country, who daily insulted the Belgians.</p>

<p>This was too much for the descendants of those who
had fought the tyrannies of Spain, Austria, and France.
Public opinion became excited, and in 1828 a union was
concluded between the Catholics, partisans of tradition,
and the Liberals, who had adopted the ideas of the French
Revolution. Threatened in their common interests and
privileges, Catholics and Liberals worked together to obtain
redress of their grievances and to defend their liberties.</p>

<p>Like Joseph II, the Dutch King refused to hear their
complaints, and continued to offend the Belgian people.
In 1830 an event of great importance fanned the revolt
into flame.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> In July the people of Paris overthrew the
French legitimist monarchy and the government of
Charles X. Just as the Brabant Revolution of 1789 was
inspired in the first instance by events in Paris and by
the fall of the Bastile, so the “July days” gave the final
impulse to the Belgians in August. On the evening of
August 25, the Brussels Opera House gave a performance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>of Auber’s <i>La Muette de Portici</i>. When the hero of the
piece sang the famous air appealing for revolt and liberty,
the effect on the emotions of his hearers was such as to
cause them to rush into the streets and then and there
inaugurate a revolt against the Dutch. They sacked the
house of Van Maenen, the unpopular minister of William
I, and that of Libri, the editor of the official governmental
newspaper, and attacked the homes of many against
whom hatred had long been growing. A guard of citizens
was raised to maintain order and a Committee of Regency
was established in the Hôtel de Ville. The French tricolor,
which had first been hoisted—and this proves the
interference of French clubs at the beginning of the
Revolution—was replaced by the old Brabant tricolor
(black, yellow, red), which is now the Belgian flag. The
other chief towns followed and confined their Dutch
garrisons within the citadels and forts. Meanwhile
a deputation was sent to the King, to petition for the
administrative separation of Belgium and Holland,
retaining, however, their personal union. William I,
unaware of the gravity of the situation, paid scarcely any
attention to the delegates. He sent a Dutch army nearly
10,000 strong, with many guns, under Prince Frederick,
his younger son, to attack Brussels, where the revolutionists
held the lower town. The troops fought their
way to the very heart of the upper town, but were
stopped at the Place Royale by the stubborn resistance
of the Belgian volunteers. These were merely Brussels
citizens, reinforced by 300 volunteers from Liège under
Charles Rogier, 200 from Louvain, with Jenneval, author
of the “Brabançonne,”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and others from various Walloon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>towns. For three days there was terrible street fighting,
and on the night of September 26-27 Prince Frederick,
with at least 1,500 killed and many wounded, admitted
his defeat and left Brussels. Meanwhile a provisional
government had been established, composed of Baron
d’Hoogvorst, the commander of the volunteers; Charles
Rogier, who afterward became the Belgian prime minister;
Count Felix de Merode; Van de Weyer, afterward Belgian
minister in London; Gendebien, the leader of the
French party among the revolutionists, Joly, and De
Potter. On October 4, 1830, this provisional government
declared Belgium an independent state, and announced
its intention of preparing a constitution which
was to be approved and adopted by a national congress.
A special commission decided, on October 12, in favor
of a constitutional monarchy. The final decree of the
congress establishing this constitution as law was voted
on February 7, 1831.</p>

<p>The basis of the new Belgian constitution consisted
of the charters and privileges of the different Belgian
provinces and cities, which dated from the Middle Ages,
and especially the “Joyeuse Entrée” of Brabant, of which
mention has already been made. Other liberties, required
by the spirit of modern times, were added: equality of
all the Belgians before the law; freedom of worship, of
the press, of association, of educational teaching, and
the right to vote was accorded to all Belgians who paid
a certain amount in taxes.</p>

<p>Some time after the provisional government had
declared Belgium an independent state a conference of
the powers was held, on November 4, 1830, in London,
to consider the new situation created by the Belgian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
revolt: Van der Weyer was sent to represent the Belgian
interests. On December 20, a motion made by the
British delegate, Lord Palmerston, was adopted, which
declared Belgium an “independent power.” The victory
of the revolutionists was thus confirmed. At the same
time, the plan of a small but active party among them,
who had attempted the reannexation of the country to
France, was defeated.</p>

<p>Another important question was now to be settled—the
choice of a monarch for the new kingdom. The
Belgian congress excluded the candidacy of the Prince
of Orange, who was favored by England and Prussia,
since the accession of this prince would mean practically
reannexation by Holland. Under the influence of the
French sympathizers, led by Gendebien, of the provisional
government, and by its president, Surlet de Chokier, the
Belgian congress decided to offer the crown to the Duke
of Nemours, younger son of the French King, Louis-Philippe.
This scheme could not be acceded to by England,
since Belgium would then have been under the direct
influence of France. The English ministry, on February
4, unanimously resolved to declare war on France if
Louis-Philippe accepted the offer. So the French King
was compelled to decline it on behalf of his son. Finally,
on June 4, 1831, the Belgian congress elected Prince
Leopold of Saxe-Cobourg-Gotha, widower of the Princess
Charlotte of England. Leopold had fought gallantly
in the army of the Allies against Napoleon in 1813 and
1814, and had just refused the crown of Greece. He was
solemnly inaugurated at Brussels on June 21 as King of
the Belgians. He was considered an English prince, and
for the moment France resented his election; but Leopold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
quieted the jealousy of Louis-Philippe by marrying the
daughter of the French King, Louise of Orléans.</p>

<p>Another question to be settled was the delimitation of
the boundaries of the new kingdom. On January 20 and
27, the Conference of London had issued two protocols,
proposing that Belgium be made a perpetually neutral
state; that Holland take all the territory that belonged
to the Dutch republic in 1790, and that the Grand
Duchy of Luxemburg become an appanage of the house
of Orange; that Belgium should be charged with <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">16</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">31</span></span> of
the national debt of the former United Kingdom of the
Netherlands.</p>

<p>These protocols, favorable to Holland, were immediately
accepted by the Dutch King, but unequivocally
rejected by the Belgians. The second article of the
London protocols robbed them of Dutch Flanders—the
north of the ancient county—of the towns of Maestricht
and Venloo and the strip of Limburg surrounding them,
and also of the Grand Duchy, a part of the old Belgian
province of Luxemburg. The loss of this territory seemed
the more unjust as the inhabitants of those regions had
participated in the Belgian revolt and did not desire
annexation by Holland.</p>

<p>The negotiations between the powers and the Belgians
would never have reached a settlement but for King
Leopold. The Belgian King persuaded the Conference
of London to supersede its protocols by a declaration in
eighteen articles, leaving the matter in dispute to be
directly negotiated between Leopold and William of
Holland, with the good offices of the great powers. The
Dutch King refused to recognize the eighteen articles
and, on August 2, twelve days after the accession to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
throne of Leopold, invaded Belgium. King Leopold displayed
military skill and courage, but the Belgians had
no strong army and their ill-trained troops were badly
defeated at Louvain and at Hasselt. Impending disaster
was prevented by the sudden arrival of a French
army, sent by Louis-Philippe, to whom the Belgian King
had appealed for help. The French repulsed the Dutch.
This intervention of France seriously alarmed the other
powers, and especially England. Fearing that French
influence might regain a foothold in the new kingdom,
they precipitately drafted another protocol, called the
Twenty-four Articles, in place of the former eighteen, and
took from Belgium the whole of the area in dispute,
except the district of Arlon, in Luxemburg. Again the
Belgians refused to be stripped; but the threat of invasion
by a German army finally compelled them to accede. On
November 15, 1831, Belgium, France, and England signed
the Treaty of the Twenty-four Articles, to which Russia,
Prussia, and Austria soon afterward assented.</p>

<p>This time Holland was unwilling to yield, and the
Dutch refused to evacuate the territory they occupied,
especially the citadel of Antwerp. A French army,
under Gérard, marched for the second time into Belgium,
besieged the Antwerp stronghold, and forced the Dutch
to capitulate (1832). King William continued to refuse
to subscribe to any agreement until 1838. Then, suddenly,
he gave his adherence to the Twenty-four Articles.
The Conference of London met again and, on April 18,
1839, the final Treaty of London was signed. The Belgians
were given a large reduction in what was agreed
should be their contribution to the debt of the Netherlands,
but were forced to surrender the territories agreed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
upon by the treaty of 1831. They did it very reluctantly,
but had no other choice.</p>

<p>This Treaty of London is the famous “scrap of paper”
of which the German chancellor spoke so disdainfully on
August 14, 1914. It settled the external relations of Belgium
in Europe. By that treaty, Belgium was declared
to be an independent kingdom and was to remain
“a perpetually neutral state,” under the guaranty of the
five great powers. The neutrality of Belgium had been
imposed upon the new kingdom at the instance chiefly
of England, who desired above all to maintain it as a
bulwark against France. As King Leopold I himself
writes to Queen Victoria on February 15, 1852, “this
neutrality was in the real interest of this country, but
our good congress here did <i>not</i> wish it: it was <i>imposé</i>
upon them.”</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that so much has been said about
the neutrality of Belgium since the beginning of the
European war, it seems worth while to explain briefly
what ought to be understood by the words “permanent
neutrality,” used by the Conference of London.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Article VII of the Treaty of London declares: “Belgium,
within the limits specified in Articles I, II, and IV,
shall form an independent and <i>perpetually neutral</i> state.
It shall be bound to observe such neutrality toward all
other states.” A distinction must be made between the
neutrality imposed by this article on Belgium and the
occasional neutrality of a state, which during a war
between other powers wishes to avoid the conflict and,
in a perfectly voluntary manner, proclaims that decision
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>to the world. In the recent European war, the United
States of America observed such an “occasional”
neutrality.</p>

<p>Permanent neutrality is quite another thing. History
shows that there are certain countries, certain geographical
zones, which, by virtue of their situation, are in some way
predestined to become periodically the theater of struggles
between nations. The subjection of such a country to
the exclusive influence of one great power has always
marked a breakdown of the European balance of power.
The idea of placing these zones by means of a treaty in
the position of countries outside the possible zone of
international conflicts corresponds to a general plan of
establishing a régime of peace on the basis of reciprocal
and voluntary restriction of action. From this point of
view, neutralization is essentially a factor for peace. It
follows that the state which is perpetually neutral has
not only its own individual meaning and independent
mission, but is an important “wheel” in the general policy.
This is the case with Belgium, as it was established by
the great powers after the revolt of 1830, and that is the
true meaning of the statement that it was to be “perpetually
neutral.”</p>

<p>Between the neutralized state and the creators of its
neutrality there thus exist reciprocal obligations. The
contracting powers between them undertake engagements
whereby they guarantee to the neutralized state the
privileged condition of enjoying permanent peace; while
on the other side, the neutralized state accepts the obligations
which protect the European balance of power.
In that way, each of the contracting powers is bound not
to attack the neutral state; not to invite it to abandon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
its peaceful attitude; to defend it against any power,
co-contracting or not, which would compel it to abandon
its neutrality. The inviolability of the neutralized territory
is agreed upon by this means, for violation would
mean for such a state a breach of its own neutrality. On
the other hand, the neutralized state must itself defend
its neutrality, and adopt all the measures needed for
such defense. For this reason, international law holds
that a neutralized state which commits an act of defense
is not to be considered as being in state of war with the
power which violates its neutrality.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Moreover, the neutral
state must prevent troops or convoys of a belligerent
power from passing through its territory.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Finally,
such a state ought to remain a truly independent state,
for if it places or allows itself to be placed in a position of
dependence upon another power it destroys the European
balance of power, the origin of its international status.</p>

<p>Some authorities on international law<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> maintain that
in case of violation of the neutral territory by a belligerent,
the contracting powers have not only the right,
but the duty, to interfere <i>ex officio</i>, and to protect the
neutral state by military power, even without the consent
of the latter. On this point, however, opinion is divided.</p>

<p>Does the neutral possess the right to conclude alliances
with a foreign power? This question is a little more
difficult to determine exactly, but it may be settled in the
following manner. Every alliance has in view the possibility
of an armed conflict. It follows logically from this
that the right of the neutral state to contract alliances
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>corresponds very closely to its right of making war. If it
is necessary to forbid such a state every alliance which
would tend to draw it into an armed conflict with
third parties, it ought to be granted without hesitation
the right of concluding any understanding which should
have for its sole object the protection of the nation against
foreign aggression. And a defensive agreement tending to
facilitate for the neutral state the carrying out of the part
it is compelled to play in the maintenance of the European
balance of power—the very basis of its neutrality—is
certainly permissible, and, under certain circumstances,
may even seem necessary; for example, when the neutral
state seems too weak to resist by its own force a possibly
powerful invasion. But it is obvious that the neutral
state may never conclude either an offensive or a defensive
alliance which would impose upon it the obligation of
possible co-operation in the defense of a foreign territory.
That is the true meaning of the permanent neutrality
imposed on Belgium by the Treaty of London, and it
will become clearer when we look at the subsequent facts
of history.</p>

<p>In 1870, on the eve of the Franco-German War, Bismarck,
with the object of alienating from France the
sympathy of the neutral nations, and especially that of
England, published a draft treaty, three or four years
old, and in the handwriting of Napoleon III’s ambassador,
whereby France was to annex Belgium. This publication
aroused public opinion in England, and, giving
expression to English feeling, Disraeli told Parliament
that “the treaties on which are based the independence
and neutrality of Belgium” had been concluded <i>in the
general interest of Europe</i> and also with a very clear idea of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
their importance for England. He added: “It is a fundamental
principle of the policy of this country, that the
country situated along the coasts of Dunkirk to the North
Sea islands should be possessed by free and prosperous
states practising the arts of peace, in order that these countries
should not belong to a great military power.” In
conformity with these declarations the English government
proposed to France and to Prussia to observe the
guaranty by way of co-operation between the English
forces and the forces of one of the belligerents against the
other in case of the violation by the latter of the neutrality
of Belgium. This arrangement was accepted on both
sides, and laid down in the formal treaties dated August 9
and 11, 1870. Those special treaties were to be in force
“during the war and for one year thereafter,” and the
final paragraph expressly stated that, after this period, the
regulations of the Treaty of London (1839) should be
regarded as in force.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> This treaty it was that was thought
to protect Belgium when the country’s neutrality was
violated by Germany on August 3, 1914.</p>

<p class="center">INDEPENDENT BELGIUM</p>

<p>In 1832 King Leopold I married Louise-Marie, daughter
of the French King Louis-Philippe, who, through her
womanly virtues, had made herself greatly beloved. The
first Queen of the Belgians died in 1850, leaving three
children: Leopold, Duke of Brabant, who afterward
became King Leopold II; Philippe, Count of Flanders;
and Charlotte, who married Archduke Maximilian of
Austria. Under the patronage of Napoleon III, Maximilian
was for some years Emperor of Mexico, and 2,000
Belgian volunteers followed him into that country.
Napoleon III abandoned him when political troubles
broke out in Mexico, and, notwithstanding the stubborn
resistance he offered to the army of the Republicans,
Maximilian fell into the hands of his enemies and was
shot at Queretaro in 1867 by order of Juarez. As a result
of this tragedy Empress Charlotte became insane.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the first King of the Belgians had developed
the economic resources of Belgium. He was determined
in his policy of maintaining the permanent neutrality of
the country, as imposed by the Treaty of London. He
preserved very friendly relations with Queen Victoria of
England, and the correspondence between the two sovereigns
shows that the first King of the Belgians would have
found in her a mighty protector in the hour of trial. In a
letter dated from Buckingham Palace in 1852, Queen
Victoria, dealing with the fear of a <i>coup d’état</i> on the part
of “such an extraordinary man” as Louis-Napoleon—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
future Napoleon III—asserted that any violation of
Belgian neutrality would mean a <i>casus belli</i> for her
government.</p>

<p>How strongly the throne of Leopold I was established
among his own people was shown by the fact that during
the Revolution of 1848, which nearly resulted in the overthrow
of all the thrones of Europe, Belgium alone kept
herself aloof from the European turmoil, and some French
adventurers who had tried to cross the frontier and, with
the help of some unpatriotic Belgians, to proclaim a
republic on Belgian soil, were quickly disarmed in the
skirmish at Risquons-Tout, near Mouscron, in West
Flanders. King Leopold consistently regarded himself
as a constitutional king, and won thereby the confidence
and the respect of the nation. During his reign Belgium
gave many proofs of her spirit of enterprise and economic
vitality. In 1835 she constructed the first railway that
existed on the Continent, connecting Brussels and Malines.
The country likewise prepared itself for defense against
foreign invasion, and built the fortifications of Antwerp,
making this city the ultimate bulwark of national defense.
In 1860, the octrois, a sort of communal customs levied
upon entering Belgian towns, were abolished; and in
1863 the tolls of the Scheldt, paid to the Dutch by all
vessels coming from Antwerp, were discontinued.</p>

<p>From a political point of view the old union of 1828 between
Catholics and Liberals had disappeared. From 1847
the personnel of the ministries was no longer composed
of members of both parties, but of representatives of one
party only, to the exclusion of those of the other. The
Liberals were in power from 1847 to 1855; the Catholics
followed, and they in turn retired before a street riot in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
1857; the Liberals again held power throughout the reign
of Leopold I. The first King of the Belgians died on
December 10, 1865.</p>

<p>The Duke of Brabant succeeded him under the name
of Leopold II. Born on April 9, 1835, in 1853 he married
Marie-Henriette, archduchess of Austria, who died in
1902. The only son of this marriage, the Count of
Hainaut, died at the age of ten years, in 1869.</p>

<p>The birth of the young prince Leopold gave occasion
to many rejoicings among the people, who were extremely
happy to see the future of their national dynasty assured.
Leopold inherited from his father an acute knowledge of
men and things, unusual tact, sound common sense, and
respect for his mission as a constitutional sovereign.</p>

<p>On April 9, 1853, when he was already Duke of
Brabant (the title given to the Belgian crown prince)
he was made a member of the Belgian Senate. On
this occasion the King, his father, presenting him to
the assembled senators, said of him: “I found in him
much discretion and common sense, so I taught him all
that is essential and useful for the conduct of political
affairs.” On August 22, 1853, Leopold married Henriette,
archduchess of Austria; this marriage united again the
new Belgian dynasty with the heirs of Maria Theresa
and Charles V.</p>

<p>Then began for Leopold a very interesting and important
period. By touring the world and visiting foreign
countries, he prepared himself for the principal task of
his royal life—to teach the Belgians how to take up commercial
and colonial expansion. For, if Leopold I especially
consolidated the young Belgian kingdom, from an
interior as well as from an exterior point of view, King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
Leopold II was the pioneer of the expansion which resulted
in the commercial and industrial prosperity of his country.</p>

<p>From 1854 to 1855, Leopold visited successively Egypt,
Palestine, Greece, Italy, and Switzerland; he met with a
splendid reception at Jerusalem. In 1860, he undertook
a new journey in Turkey and Asia Minor. In 1862-63
he went through Spain, Algeria, Tunisia, Malta, and
Egypt. Finally, he spent the years 1864 and 1865
visiting India.</p>

<p>It is then not surprising to hear him, when, in 1855, he
made his first speech in the Senate, saying: “We must
show the Belgian flag all over the world. A young
nationality must be daring and always love progress.”
He showed henceforth great interest in science and arts
and public works and recommended many times the
creation of Belgian navigation lines.</p>

<p>In 1859 he began his great campaign for colonial expansion.
He told the Belgians they should create everywhere
markets for their commerce and exchanges for
their industry. In connection with this scheme, he
enjoined them to make the port of Antwerp the best and
greatest port of the Continent. All this was done and
said before Leopold himself became a king. On December
17, 1865, he succeeded his father as king of the
Belgians. During his reign he kept pleasant relations
with all the countries of Europe, and this friendship was
sealed by the visits many kings paid to Brussels. The
Belgian capital greeted successively William I of Prussia,
William III and Queen Emma of the Netherlands,
Alfonso XII of Spain, William II, the young German
Emperor. Leopold himself went, in 1872, to visit England
and took part at a great dinner where the celebrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
Disraeli welcomed him and spoke with much respect of
the late King Leopold I, the wise man, “who was virtually
a British prince.” Peace and international friendship
thus favored the first years of Leopold’s reign, when
suddenly, in 1870, the Franco-German War broke out.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned Great Britain’s interventions
in order to preserve the neutrality of Belgium.
But the Belgians themselves took their part in the defense
of that neutrality. On hearing of the declaration of war,
the Belgian government ordered general mobilization of
the army and sent troops to the frontiers, in order to
prevent any attempt by the belligerents to use the
territory. On September 1, 1870, great danger arose:
the French, defeated at Sedan, seemed resolved to try to
escape capitulation by seeking a refuge and continuing
the fight on Belgian soil. But this event did not happen
and the Belgian army preserved the frontiers of the
country untouched.</p>

<p>When peace returned, Leopold II interested himself in
science and created, in 1874, the “Prix du Roi” for
scientific research, hoping thereby, as he said himself, to
stimulate the enterprises of the Belgian scientists and to
have the world devote its attention to Belgian life and
interests. In 1876 the King took advantage of the
Congress for Eugenics held in Brussels for promoting
interest in the social welfare of the poorer classes and for
urging the construction of cheap houses for workmen.</p>

<p>On September 12, 1876, a great event took place. The
King presided at the Brussels Geographical Conference,
where representatives of the various European countries
assembled. Out of this conference grew the <i>Association
internationale africaine</i>, which undertook the exploration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
of the Congo and the fight against the slave-drivers in
Africa. As a consequence of all this, in February, 1888,
the International Conference of Berlin took place, which
created the Independent Congo State, with the king of the
Belgians as sovereign. This state, by the will of the
King, the consent of the powers, and the vote of the
Belgian Parliament, became a Belgian colony in 1908.</p>

<p>Another great task of the King’s life, was the defense of
the country. Leopold always proclaimed his faith in the
treaties of 1839, but he never neglected to advocate
the reinforcement of the army and the construction of
fortresses, in order to repel any possible invasion. In
1885, when international peace seemed to be in danger,
the King, after a vigorous campaign, obtained a vote
from Parliament, resolving to erect the fortresses of the
Meuse—the forts at Liège and Namur, which, in 1914,
stopped for some time the German advance. Things
did not always go smoothly, and the King became very
unpopular with many people, who, absolutely confident
in the treaties of 1839, termed the King’s enterprise
as “militarism.” Leopold once taunted a member of
the Belgian Parliament, who was opposed to the contemplated
fortification, saying: “Never go out without
an umbrella, Sir!”</p>

<p>In 1905 the Belgians celebrated splendidly the seventy-fifth
anniversary of Belgian independence. The King
went all over the country, encouraging the feeling of
patriotism which was then manifest and taking advantage
of that spirit for urging the enlargement of the works
of the port of Antwerp and the construction of a circle of
outer forts, which should defend the city. After a great
fight, he obtained the vote from Parliament, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
the proposed system of fortification was not entirely
accepted by the politicians.</p>

<p>His last victory was the reinforcement of the Belgian
army, the suppression of the old Napoleonic system,
called “le tirage au sort,” and the establishment of
personal service. The bill of the new law was brought
to him to be signed on his deathbed. Before leaving this
world, he confirmed with his royal signature the law which
he had finally obtained from his all-too-pacifist subjects.
With a sigh of supreme satisfaction, the great
King died in December, 1909.</p>

<p>During his life he had many enemies. A constitutional
king, he sometimes went farther than the limits of his
power, but he did it with the greatness and the security
of his country always in his mind. Politicians more than
once attacked him violently, but history will avenge him,
saying: “He made it possible for his country to defend
itself in the hour of great trial.”</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE GREAT TRIAL</p>

<p>When the nephew of King Leopold, Prince Albert,
became king of the Belgians under the name of Albert I,
he certainly never imagined that a day would come when
the very existence of his country would be put at stake
by the felony of one of the powers which were pledged
to defend Belgian neutrality.</p>

<p>The first years of the new reign went on peacefully.
Albert I devoted his attention particularly to social and
economic affairs, but he did not forget the problems of
Belgian’s defense. In 1912, thanks to the efforts and the
help of the Belgian Premier, Baron Charles de Brogueville,
he obtained a new army bill, which considerably reinforced
the strength of the Belgian army. Two years had hardly
elapsed when the Great Trial came! On August 2, 1914,
the German Minister to Brussels appeared at the Belgian
Foreign Office, and presented on behalf of his government
a “very confidential” note, asking passage through
Belgium for the German troops on their way to France.
Twelve hours were granted to the Belgian government
for a reply.</p>

<p>The night of August 2, 1914, was a terrible night for
the King and his ministers. They had to decide upon
the future, on the existence of their country. None
wavered; they decided to remain loyal to their pledge
and to oppose to the German invaders “the force
of arms.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span></p>

<p>The Belgian army then hardly counted 115,000 men;
they had no big guns, hardly any machine guns and,
as a consequence of the army bill of 1912, everything
was in full process of reorganization. Nevertheless, the
Belgian government did not hesitate.</p>

<p>On August 2, at 7 o’clock in the morning, a man
calmly brought to the German Minister at Brussels the
answer to the German ultimatum: the reply was a
categorical refusal to let the German army pass through
Belgium. On August 4, the army of General von Emmich,
some 80,000 men, tried to take the fortified position of
Liège by surprise. But the 30,000 Belgians of General
Leman defended their hastily constructed trenches so
well that many German regiments beat a hasty retreat.
Panic already prevailed in the German town of Aix-la-Chapelle,
where the news spread that the Belgians were
invading German soil! However, in the midst of the confusion,
a German column, under the command of Ludendorff,
who then won his first laurels of the war, succeeded
in breaking through the Belgian defenses. On the morning
of August 7, the city of Liège was occupied by the enemy.</p>

<p>The Belgian troops succeeded in escaping capture
and went to rejoin the Belgian field army, posted on the
river Gette, covering both Brussels and Antwerp. If
the city of Liège was in the enemy’s hands, the forts
continued to resist, and it was only when the <span class="err" title="original: 305- and 420-centimenter">30.5- and
42.0-centimeter</span> guns arrived from Germany, that one
after another they were shattered to bits. The fort of
Loncin, where General Leman had continued to resist,
exploded, and was taken on the sixteenth of August. It
had stopped the advance of the First Army under von
Kluck for a week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span></p>

<p>And so it was that the army of von Kluck did not come
in touch with the Belgian field army near Louvain before
August 10. The number of the invading troops was so
great and the danger of the Belgians being cut off from
their Antwerp base so imminent, that King Albert
decided to retire, after some combats at Haelen, Hauthem,
and Aerschot, to the entrenched position of Antwerp.
This happened on August 19. The flood of the invaders
went over Louvain, Brussels, and then turned southward.
There, thanks to the delay procured by the resistance of
Liège, stood, on the Sambre, the Fifth French Army,
and, on the canal from Mons to Condé, the British
Expeditionary Force under Sir John French. Moreover,
the Belgian fortress of Namur, at the confluence of the
Sambre and the Meuse, offered a strong <i>point d’appui</i>
for the Allied forces in the south of Belgium.</p>

<p>Events happened, however, very rapidly. Namur
fell under the attack of the Second German Army under
von Bülow and the forts were destroyed by the fire of
the giant German guns. The Belgian garrison, under
General Michel, partly succeeded in escaping to France
on August 23. The same day, the French on the Sambre
were forced back by von Bülow and von Kluck maneuvering
together, and the British at Mons were compelled to
fall back and to begin their glorious retreat on Le Cateau.</p>

<p>When the battles of the Sambre and Mons were raging,
the Belgian field army suddenly made a sortie from Antwerp,
in order to menace the Germans in the rear. They
had a great fight on a line between Vilvorde and Aerschot,
but, having no large guns, did not succeed in breaking
through the German observation army which covered
the line from Liège to Brussels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span></p>

<p>They made a second sortie on September 9. They
succeeded in recapturing Aerschot and were about to
retake Louvain, when German reinforcements stopped
their advance. This sortie retained in Belgium important
German reinforcements, which were on their way to restore
the German fortunes on the Marne. The German General
Staff frankly admits the importance of this move on the
part of the Belgian army.</p>

<p>A third sortie did not succeed, for, exactly at this time
(September 27), the Germans began the siege of Antwerp.
They wanted to put an end to these continuous threats
on their rear and their communication lines with Germany.
Just as Liège and Namur fell under the fire of the <span class="err" title="original: 305- and 420-centimenter">30.5- and
42.0-centimeter</span> guns, Antwerp proved irremediably
lost after two or three days’ bombardment. The British
marine fusiliers and men of the Naval Reserve, sent by
Churchill with the hope of delaying the fall of the fortress,
could merely support the morale of the Belgian defenders
by their presence, but that was all. On the evening
of October 6 the Belgian field army, under the personal
conduct of King Albert, succeeded in leaving Antwerp
without the Germans being aware of it. The city continued
to be defended by the garrison troops and the
British. After a terrible bombardment of thirty-six
hours the last defenders escaped in their turn, and on
October 9 the civilian authorities surrendered the town
to General von Beseler. The Germans boasted of the
great war spoils found in the town, but they were
extremely angry to find the city empty of troops.</p>

<p>The Belgian field army, meanwhile, accomplished a
very dangerous but admirably conducted retreat through
Flanders, and stopped on the Yser, on October 14-15.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
The soldiers were exhausted. They had barely taken
up their position along the little river when a mighty
German army, composed partly of some corps of von
Beseler’s army, partly of fresh troops—mostly university
men, volunteers—just arrived from Germany, appeared,
with the aim of breaking through in the direction of
Dunkirk and Calais.</p>

<p>During more than seven days, 48,000 Belgian infantrymen,
“in the last stage of exhaustion”—so said Sir John
French in his dispatch to the War Office—supported by
a force of not more than 6,000 French marine fusiliers
defended the Yser positions against some 100,000 enemies,
provided with very heavy artillery and all the means of
modern warfare. On October 25, when at a certain point
the Germans finally broke through, French reinforcements
arrived and the Belgian General Staff decided to
flood the positions in front of the last Belgian line. This
put an end to the struggle. The troops of the Duke of
Würtemberg suffered an ignominious defeat. They
never reached either Dunkirk or Calais.</p>

<p>The Germans were not more fortunate on the Ypres
front: here the British of Sir John French, supported by
some French troops, also held their line, and at the close
of November, 1914, the struggle ended in the south of
Belgium and the long period of trench warfare began.</p>

<p>Except for that little slip of country including Dixmude,
Nieuport, and Ypres, Belgium was now under German
occupation. Then began the “war of the civilians.”
Already during the invasion, in that fateful month of
August, many civilians had been killed by the invading
troops. Under pretext that there were <i>francs tireurs</i>—which
should be categorically denied, there never being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
an organized “<i>franc-tireur</i>” war in Belgium—the invaders
committed horrible atrocities in the region of Liège, at
Aerschot, Louvain, Tamines, Andennes, Namur, Termonde,
and in the south of Luxemburg, burning a large
number of houses, pillaging, and killing over 6,000 people,
among them old men, women, and children. Terrorization
seemed the immediate aim of this peculiar system of
warfare.</p>

<p>When these troops had disappeared in the direction
of Paris, General von der Goltz was intrusted with the
task of organizing the administration of occupied Belgium.
He arrived at Brussels on September 1, 1914, with some
25 military and civilian officials. Belgium was now
divided into two parts: the “General Government,”
including the whole of the occupied territory, except
both East and West Flanders, and the “Etappengebiet”
or “army zone,” including these last two provinces. The
“General Government” was subject to the authority of
the Governor General, residing at Brussels; the “Etappengebiet”
was responsible to the army commanders.
Along the coast was established the “Marine-gebiet” or
coast defense, under the command of Admiral von
Schroeder, residing at Bruges. At the head of each
province was put a military governor, and in every
district a <i>Kreischef</i>. Every town had a local “Kommandantur.”
Besides these military officials were the
civilian officials of the “Zivilverwaltung.”</p>

<p>Between these two elements, the military and the
civilians, there did not always exist great cordiality, and,
when they did not agree, the military always had the
last word. Also, at Brussels, the authority of the
Governor General was sometimes handicapped by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
intervention of the Quartermaster General, von Sauberzweig,
representative of the German General Staff, and
it seems beyond doubt that the excesses and crimes
committed by the German government at Brussels were
frequently imposed by the military party. The murder
of Edith Cavell and the deportation of civilians to
Germany and to the firing-line were certainly acts of
the military.</p>

<p>The situation of the Belgian civilian population became
now very peculiar. The Belgian government, which had
left Antwerp together with the King, had accepted the
hospitality of the French government at Havre; the
King and Queen were with the troops on the Yser. There
remained in Belgium, as representatives of the national
power, the burgomasters or mayors of the various towns,
the parish priests, and the bishops. They were to be
the leaders of the oppressed population. Cardinal
Mercier took up the fight against the crimes, the excesses,
and the illegalities of the occupying power, and the mayor
of the capital, Max, stirred the people by his patriotic
and gallant attitude. The Germans sent him to Germany
for having been too outspoken in his feelings; he remained
there in confinement till the end of the war. They did
not dare to arrest Cardinal Mercier, but they tried by
all means to silence him and to prevent his encouraging,
in his pastorals and letters addressed to his flock,
the sense of patriotism and the endurance of the people.
The Cardinal never missed any occasion to tell the
Belgians what was their duty in the face of the invader,
or to protest against atrocities committed, or to try to
prevent brutalities as, for instance, at the time of the
awful deportations. The bishops of Liège and Namur also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
took up the same energetic attitude. In many towns and
villages the burgomasters did their duty as calmly as
the priests.</p>

<p>Thanks to the attitude of their civilian and ecclesiastical
leaders, the Belgians found the necessary patience to
endure the harshness, the persecutions, and the privations
of the new régime. It may be said that, generally speaking,
they offered, on “the interior front,” as good a
resistance as the soldiers on the Yser front.</p>

<p>Their cities were occupied by German garrisons; their
houses sometimes filled with German officers or requisitioned
in order to serve as a German <i>Casino</i> or <i>Soldatenheim</i>.
Every month, at the local <i>Kommandantur</i>, the
young men of age to bear arms, the former civic guards,
etc., must present themselves. A very severe control
was established in order to prevent the young men from
escaping to Holland and rejoining the Belgian army.
In order to prevent this, the Belgian frontier to the north
was provided with three lines of electrified wire and
soldiers were constantly patrolling, ready to fire on those
who should succeed in cutting the wires and passing.
These terrible threats did not prevent thousands of young
Belgians from facing the ordeal and from getting through
these wires, on their way to the Belgian army on the
Yser. From Holland, they went to England, then
reached France where they were received in Belgian
instruction camps and prepared for “doing their bit”
in the Yser trenches.</p>

<p>The parents or relatives of these young Belgians were
held responsible for the escape of their sons and heavily
fined or imprisoned. The German administration applied,
indeed, the principle of collective responsibility. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
the fault of one individual, the whole community was
punished. So, for instance, cutting of a telephone wire,
singing a patriotic song, distributing secret newspapers,
all this was punished by heavy fines imposed on a whole
town or village.</p>

<p>Everywhere the German criminal or secret police,
organized by Governor General von Bissing, was at work,
trying to get as many Belgians as possible into prison.
The German military penal code was applied to Belgium
for offenses termed as endangering the security of the
German army. These crimes were punished by military
tribunals, where no Belgian barrister was admitted, and
where people were condemned to death or to heavy
penalties without appeal. In one year alone, 1915-16,
103,092 Belgians were thus condemned by these military
tribunals, and 100 death penalties were pronounced,
many of them being immediately executed. The best-known
cases were those of Edith Cavell, Gabrielle Petit,
Franck, Baekelmans, etc. This régime of terror did not
curb the courage of the people.</p>

<p>The Germans tried to create despair and dissension
by spreading false news, by announcing loudly and daily
their victories, by creating German or Germanized papers,
such as <i>Le Bruxellois</i>, by exciting the animosity against
the Allies, especially against England, by boasting that
the Belgians had been left in the lurch by their influential
friends.</p>

<p>To counteract this poison propaganda, a secret press
was created at Brussels and in many other towns. The
“Libre Belgique,” organized by the editor of the former
Belgian paper <i>Le Patriote</i>, Mr. Jourdain, is the most
celebrated of them. The Germans never succeeded in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
discovering the writers or the printers, but many people,
suspected of taking part in the enterprise, were fined or
imprisoned or deported.</p>

<p>The most cunning device of the Germans was the
so-called “activism.” They knew that, before the war,
a party of Flemings, called “Flamingants,” had asked
for more influence of the Flemish tongue in Belgian
public life and advocated the creation of a Flemish
university. Governor von Bissing tried then to sow
dissension between Flemings and Walloons and to destroy
the very basis of Belgian nationality itself. He took over
the program of the Flamingants and created, with the
help of a few traitors, a Flemish university of Ghent.
Great privileges were attached to the matriculation at
this Flemish-German university. The scheme did not
succeed. Von Bissing went farther: he introduced
administrative separation between Flanders and Wallony,
and created an autonomous “Verwaltung” for Flanders
at Brussels and for Wallony at Namur, with separated
ministries. In this he was helped by a score of traitors,
who called themselves “activists,” and who were particularly
attracted by bribes and high positions offered
by the Germans. They formed a so-called “Council for
Flanders,” whose members went even to visit the German
Chancellor at Berlin.</p>

<p>A shudder of revolt passed through the country, and
the great majority of the Flemings formally condemned
the “activists.” The Belgian magistrates decided to
arrest the leader of the activists, Borms, who called
himself the Flemish “Minister for War,” under the very
nose of the Germans. Borms was arrested at Brussels,
but instantly liberated by his German protectors. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
clearly showed the relations of the “activists” toward
the enemy, but the courageous Belgian magistrates were
deported to Germany.</p>

<p>The resistance of the Belgians was never broken, but
material life was very difficult. Owing to the requisitions
of horses, cattle, fruits, etc., there came a day when
starvation was near. Then was founded, in October,
1914, the admirable Commission for Relief in Belgium,
with Herbert Hoover at its head, who undertook the great
task of revictualing Belgium during the occupation.</p>

<p>The Germans had not only requisitioned food; they
also requisitioned the very means of industrial life.
According to a scheme conceived and worked out by the
president of the “Allgemeine Elektrizitätsgesellschaft,”
Walther Rathenau, Belgium was to be stripped of all
natural and manufactured products which could help
the German army in continuing and winning the war.
Coal, metals, chemical products, wood, wool, linen, cotton,
copper, rubber, machines, machine tools, oil, transport
material, horses, etc., were put under “saisie” by successive
decrees of von Bissing and sent to Germany, with
the help of German business men, who visited the Belgian
factories and marked the things to be requisitioned.</p>

<p>A consequence of this was the closing of many factories
and the creation of an enormous number of forced strikers.
These men, then, were considered as idlers and, by order
of the military, taken out of their houses and sent by
whole trains, in cattle-trucks, to Germany. There they
had to work for the German army, even making munitions
to kill their brethren. This was the origin of the awful
deportations, which stirred the conscience of the civilized
world. About 150,000 Belgians, mostly workmen, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
intellectuals, bourgeois, and even schoolboys not excepted,
were either sent to Germany or to the firing-line in France
and Belgium, where they were compelled to dig trenches,
construct roads, etc. A large number of them refused
flatly to work for the enemy. They were submitted in
the camps to real tortures, beaten, martyrized, and scores
of them died. Others were sent back, exhausted by their
martyrdom, and died on arriving in their native home.</p>

<p>The financial wealth of Belgium was also crippled by
the heavy war levies imposed on provinces, towns, and
villages. In December, 1914, von Bissing imposed on
the Belgian provinces a collective war levy of 40,000,000
francs monthly; in November, 1916, this levy had reached
50,000,000 francs monthly. Von Falkenhausen, who
succeeded von Bissing, raised it to 60,000,000 francs.
It would be impossible to estimate exactly the total of
the levies and fines imposed on Belgian towns and villages
during four years of war.</p>

<p>Four years, indeed, this terrible thing went on. Then,
suddenly, came “the day of revenge,” of which Cardinal
Mercier had spoken in 1917 in his letter to General von
Huehne. The mighty German war machine collapsed
under the combined effort of the Allied forces. At the
end of the battle front, near the sea, was constituted the
“group of armies of Flanders,” composed of French,
British, Americans, and Belgians, under the command
of King Albert. In September, 1918, the great offensive
began on the Flanders front. The German positions were
taken by storm, and, after a short interruption, the drive
went on again in October. Soon the Flanders coast
was evacuated, and everywhere, in Belgian towns and
villages, amidst cries of joy and tears, amidst Belgian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
flags kept jealously hidden during four years, the sturdy
troops of the Yser came home again, as victors of the
right over might.</p>

<p>At the beginning of November came the end: the
armistice was signed and the Germans compelled to
evacuate the country which they once hoped to dominate
forever. On a wonderful day in that same month,
King Albert and his queen followed by his army and by
British, French, and American troops, entered Brussels
and saw again rise before their eyes the tower of the
historic Hôtel de Ville. The nightmare was over, Belgium
was free again. And in ages to come, the children will
learn the history of that period, during which Belgium
covered itself with glory, because “it stood the test in
the hour of the Great Trial.”</p>

<p>The best work to be consulted on the history of Belgium
is that by H. Pirenne, professor in the University of Ghent,
entitled <i>Histoire de Belgique</i>, Vols. I-IV, Brussels, 1900-1911.
The work is not yet complete: the fourth volume carries us
down to 1648. Those wishing to study more in detail the
various problems of Belgian history will find the enumeration
of original sources and modern books in H. Pirenne, <i>Bibliographie
de l’histoire de Belgiques</i>, 2d ed., Brussels, 1902. For
a list of books published since 1902 see the Belgian periodical
<i>Archives belges</i>, where the important books and articles on
Belgian history are reviewed and discussed.</p>

<p>Works written in English are the following: Demetrius C.
Boulger, <i>A History of Belgium</i>, 2 vols., London, 1902-9;
J. de C. MacDonnell, <i>Belgium, Her Kings, Kingdom and
People</i>, London, 1914; R. C. K. Ensor, <i>Belgium</i>, New York
and London [1915]. The work by Boulger is mainly based
on the old work of Théodore Juste, <i>Histoire de Belgique</i> (new
edition in 3 vols., Brussels, 1895), which is not up to date and
cannot be compared with Pirenne’s <i>Histoire</i>. The works
by MacDonnell and Ensor deal especially with the contemporary
history of Belgium, the former treating Belgian politics
from the Catholic point of view, the latter being frequently
ill informed and unjust toward the Catholic party. Both
have their merits in dealing with the history of Belgium in
the nineteenth century. Modern Belgium has also been
studied by H. Charriaut, <i>la Belgique moderne</i>, Paris, 1910.
This book offers much information, but contains many mis-statements.
For social problems, see B. Seebohm Rowntree,
<i>Land and Labour: Lessons from Belgium</i>, London, 1910.
In French there exists an excellent survey of the most important
periods of Belgian history, written by G. Kurth,
<i>la nationalité belge</i>, Brussels, 1913.</p>

<p>A very readable book, well written and well illustrated,
based on accurate historical information, and dealing with
the history of Flanders in the largest sense of the word, is the
work of Edward Neville Vose, <i>The Spell of Flanders</i>, Boston,
Page Co., 1915. The author, describing the visit he made
to various Flemish towns, gives a good account of the most
striking facts of their history.</p>

the Sylva Carbonaria. The name <i>Wala</i> is to be connected with the terms
“Welsh,” “Wales,” apparently of the same origin and given to the Britons
and their country by the Anglo-Saxon invaders.</p>

in agreement with him, planned an invasion of England. The hostile
attitude of the English kings of the Norman dynasty turned the counts of
Flanders to seek again the protection of France.</p>
